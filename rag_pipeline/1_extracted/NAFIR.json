Ethiopia has enjoyed significant \nsuccess scaling up financial inclusion during the first NFIS period, \n2016-2020. This has continued throughout the lifetime of NFIS \nII as it nears its conclusion. Headline NFIS II targets for 2025, \nsuch as the number of transaction accounts per 100 adults, \nhave already been met and significantly exceeded during 2024. \nDigital transformation continues apace as digital financial services \nexperience exponential growth in the country. \nDeepening financial inclusion in agriculture will contribute \nextensively to national development objectives. Agricultural \nmodernization is a key objective of Ethiopia’s national \ndevelopment framework, the Homegrown Economic Reform \nAgenda. Deepening financial inclusion in the agricultural sector \nalso addresses a broader array of national priorities. These range \nfrom livelihood strengthening and resilience, to job creation, to \nenterprise development, to gender transformation, to climate \nadaptation, to technological innovation, to industrial development, \nto value addition, import substitution and export growth. Just \nas importantly, the sustainability of Ethiopia’s long-term growth \nand development trajectory is premised on an enduring national \ncommitment to shared prosperity through quality economic \ngrowth that benefits all members of society. \nDeepening financial inclusion means building upon basic \nfinancial access with services such as credit, savings and \ninsurance tailored to the needs of priority sectors, especially \nagriculture. Agriculture has long been underserved by the formal \nfinancial system. The sector contributes 32 percent of Ethiopia’s \ngross domestic product (GDP), 64 percent of employment, and 79 \npercent of exports, but has historically received far less than 10% \nof national credit supply. Residual financial exclusion is heavily \nconcentrated in rural areas. Over 80% of Ethiopia’s population \nlives in rural areas. Yet only 10% of rural women and 26% of rural \nmen have access to formal financial accounts.\nThe reasons for the persistent under-financing of Ethiopian \nagriculture are complex and multi-faceted. They cover deep-\nrooted challenges in both the financial and underlying real sectors, \nincluding policy and legal-regulatory frameworks, financial and \nphysical infrastructure, stakeholder capacity, uneven distribution \nof resources and technologies, and the structure and dynamics \nof smallholder agriculture. Therefore, an important foundation \nFOREWORD \nH.E. Mr. Mamo E. Mihretu\nGovernor\nNational Bank of Ethiopia\n\n5\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nfor NAFIR has been a thorough investigation of these challenges, \nincorporating extensive quantitative analyses combined with a strong \nfocus on stakeholder partnership and collaboration, as well as detailed \nreview of African and international experiences. \nNAFIR does not start from a blank slate. Investments by Government, \ndevelopment partners and the private sector to build the enabling \necosystem for agri-finance are recognized and applauded. A stock-\ntaking of these investments has been performed in the development \nof NAFIR and linked to a wide-ranging stakeholder survey to identify \nremaining gaps. In particular, close attention has been paid to \ndesigning transformative ‘game-changers’ in the spirit of the country’s \nbold economic reform process. These form the pillars of NAFIR and \nserve to integrate and energize Ethiopia’s emerging agri-finance \necosystem, not only to drive the scale-up of agri-finance overall, but \nalso to make sure it reaches the most marginalized and under-served \npopulations that need access to financial services the most.\nThe resultant NAFIR roadmap represents an innovative and \nambitious effort to  capitalize on previous investments, harness \nongoing digital advances, and build with key partners an \ninclusive financing system tailored to serve the needs of \nEthiopian agriculture. The Bank extends particular appreciation to \nthe Ministry of Agriculture for a strong and fruitful collaboration jointly \ndeveloping NAFIR. We also recognize the important engagements with \nthe Agricultural Transformation Institute and National ID. We further \nacknowledge with sincere thanks the important critical contributions \nof development partners and private sector – financial institutions, \ncooperatives, agribusiness, service providers – that were generous \nwith both their time and insights, participating in consultation and \nvalidation meetings, and responding to surveys. The participation of \nstakeholders has been vital to shaping a catalytic and demand-driven \nnational Roadmap. Extending these partnerships will be a crucial \nsuccess factor to achieve national aspirations in agriculture through \nimpactful implementation.\nWe therefore underline our continued commitment as the Bank \nto work in close collaboration with stakeholders to convert the \nNAFIR Roadmap into a practical reality so that actors in the \nagricultural sector have ready access to appropriate, affordable \nand user-friendly financial services for the shared prosperity of \nall members of society.\nH.E. Mr. Mamo E. Mihretu\nGovernor\nNational Bank of Ethiopia\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n6\nBy the Minister of Agricutlure\nAgriculture remains the cornerstone of Ethiopia’s development—\nan enduring foundation for our national prosperity and a critical \nengine of inclusive growth. With 64% of our workforce employed \nin the sector, contributing 32% to GDP and most export earnings, \nagriculture is not only the mainstay of livelihoods but also the \nplatform for ensuring food and nutrition security, resilience, and \nequitable transformation.\nYet for far too long, our farmers—particularly the vast majority of \nsmallholders—have been left on the margins of the formal financial \nsystem. Despite their central role in feeding the nation and driving \nrural economies, they receive less than 10% of total domestic credit. \nThis under-financing reflects structural weaknesses, fragmented \ninstitutional arrangements, and the absence of a coherent, sector-\nwide financing framework.\nIt is in this context that I am proud to introduce the National \nAgri-Finance Implementation Roadmap (NAFIR) 2025–2030, a \nresult of close collaboration and strategic alignment between the \nMinistry of Agriculture (MoA) and the National Bank of Ethiopia \n(NBE). At our recent landmark joint meeting, our two institutions \nreached a consensus not only on the urgent need for a dedicated \nAgricultural and Rural Enterprise Policy Bank but also on a \npractical path forward, rooted in strategic initiatives and empirical \ndata. This new chapter marks a turning point in addressing the \nsystemic constraints that have long hindered access to finance in \nthe agricultural sector.\nNAFIR is more than a roadmap—it is a bold commitment to \naction. Anchored in Ethiopia’s Homegrown Economic Reform \nAgenda 2.0 (HGER) and the Ten-Year Development Plan (TYDP), \nand aligned with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), \nthis initiative outlines a comprehensive framework to modernize \nagri-finance, unlock private sector engagement, and transform \nthe financial ecosystem that supports agriculture.\nAt its heart, NAFIR introduces three game-changing mechanisms:\n•\t\nThe National Agri-Finance Accelerator (NAFA) to mobilize \nand de-risk capital flows into agriculture,\n•\t\nFarmer Access to Streamlined Financial Services (FAST) to \nsimplify compliance and reduce transaction costs,\n•\t\nAnd an Agri-Finance Centre of Excellence (CoE) to build \ncapacity, financial literacy, and robust risk management \npractices.\nFOREWORD \nH.E. Girma Amente, PhD\nMinister of Agriculture\nFederal Democratic Republic \nof Ethiopia\n\n7\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nThrough these mechanisms, we aim to expand access to affordable \nfinance, improve productivity, strengthen rural enterprise, and \nintegrate smallholders into value-added markets and export \nopportunities. Importantly, this roadmap places a premium on climate \nresilience, gender inclusion, digital innovation, and public-private \ncoordination—all indispensable pillars of sustainable transformation.\nRealizing the vision outlined in NAFIR will require collective resolve and \ncoordinated execution. I urge all financial institutions, development \npartners, regional governments, and the private sector to join forces \nbehind this effort. By aligning our resources and priorities, we can \nbridge the financing gap, revitalize rural economies, and empower \nmillions of Ethiopian farmers and pastoralists to lead the next chapter \nof our national development story.\nLet us walk this path together—boldly, inclusively, and with a shared \ncommitment to lasting impact.\nH.E.

NAFIR proposes a package of transformative solutions that will integrate and energize \nEthiopia’s emergent agri-finance landscape through a five-year implementation framework.\nNAFIR supports the achievement of key policy objectives under the NFIS, NBE Strategy and \nTYAPP as well as the Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda 2.0 (HGER). These goals include \nthe deepening of financial inclusion in the agricultural sector; the modernization of Ethiopian \nagriculture; the strengthening of sectoral linkages between agriculture and industry; and value \naddition and export growth. Key outcomes linked to the policy objectives include improved farmer \nincomes and livelihoods, strengthened food security, economic growth, job creation, climate \nresilience, gender equality and digital transformation, and contributing to multiple UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and African Union Agenda 2063 priorities.\nNAFIR has been developed using a mixed methods approach: \n•\t\nQuantitative analysis has been performed on the demand- and supply-side data, which has \nbeen obtained from official sources and peer-reviewed research. \n•\t\nTo supplement the official data with a deeper understanding of the cyclical, distributional, and \nqualitative performance of agri-finance in Ethiopia, and to systematically engage stakeholders \non their perspectives and experiences, two rounds of stakeholder consultations took place \nduring NAFIR’s preparation (see Annexes II and III), as well as a series of validation workshops \nto review the draft output (see Annex IV). \n•\t\nThis was supplemented by qualitative analyses of the policy environment, the agricultural and \nsocio-economic context, a stock-take that has mapped Ethiopia’s agri-finance landscape, and \na comparative review of international experience. \n•\t\nThese quantitative and qualitative analyses have shaped a gap analysis together with \nrecommendations on how the identified gaps may be addressed drawing on Ethiopian, \nAfrican and wider international experiences. These recommendations have subsequently been \nstructured into a coherent over-arching NAFIR strategy, results framework, and implementation \nroadmap.\nCONTEXT\nAgriculture is under-financed in Ethiopia despite its critical contribution to the national \neconomy and society generally. In 2023-24, credit flows to agriculture represented 8 percent of \nloans disbursed by banks (24 percent, including the fertilizer financing scheme of the Commercial \nBank of Ethiopia1 [CBE]) and 18 percent of loans outstanding from microfinance institutions (MFIs). \nThis compares with the 32 percent contribution that agriculture makes to Ethiopia’s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 64 percent to the country’s employment, and 79 percent to its exports. As of 2023-\n24, just 2 percent of the total potential demand opportunity for agri-finance was fulfilled (it was 5 \n1\t\n NBE defines agricultural credit as lending to a “business that includes cultivating soil, producing crops, raising livestock, beekeeping, \nfishery and other related activities” (NBE Directive No. MFI/24/2013). The large-scale fertilizer financing scheme funded by the \nCommercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) is one major source of financing that may be categorized as ‘other related activities’. Under \nthis arrangement, significant quantities of fertilizer are imported and distributed to rural areas through regional governments and \ncooperatives. Without this scheme, farmers may not have access to fertilizer. It is therefore of high importance and makes a major \ncontribution to Ethiopian agriculture. However, the scheme does not result in the provision of credit to primary producers, as the end \nfarmer still must pay cash for the fertilizer or find credit from another source. Therefore, it does not contribute to the ETB 2,582 billion \nof potential demand from farmers for credit, as documented below. Yet the CBE fertilizer finance accounts for nearly 70 percent of \ntotal reported agri-loan disbursement for 2023/24. For purposes of the analysis in this document, the report quotes agri-finance \nstatistics that may include or exclude the CBE fertilizer finance, according to context, and as stated in the text. It is emphasized, the \nsame underlying official NBE data has been used in all cases, and any apparent differences would stem from analyses in which the \nCBE fertilizer finance has been excluded.\n\n11\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\npercent including the CBE fertilizer finance), which amounted to Ethiopian Birr (ETB) 52 billion per \nannum (the figure was ETB 125 billion 2, with the CBE fertilizer finance amount included). This sum \nwas supplied against the ETB 2,582 billion annual potential demand opportunity for agricultural \nproducers across the key agri-finance ‘use cases’3. The national Ten-Year Development Plan (TYDP) \nsets as a policy target a ETB 881 billion per annum credit flow to agriculture by 2030.\nHowever, the demand-supply gap for agri-finance in Ethiopia is not merely quantitative, but \nalso cyclical, qualitative, and distributional. Agri-finance must be tailored for different types \nof agricultural borrower4 across Ethiopia’s diverse agro-ecological zones and agricultural value \nchains to fulfil key agricultural use cases at the right time of the season: crop inputs, irrigation, \nmechanization, livestock, outputs, and insurance. Fulfilment of these use cases drives productivity \ngains, farm size expansion, post-harvest loss (PHL) reduction, and diversification. It also strengthens \nlivelihoods, gender and youth inclusion, as well as climate adaptation and resilience. In addition, \nagri-finance is necessary to enable efficient aggregation and the supply of agricultural raw materials \nto downstream agro-industries, and to mitigate the high structural risks faced by the sector.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT AND RATIONALE FOR THE ROADMAP\nThe causes of agricultural under-financing in Ethiopia are multi-faceted. Financing agriculture \ninvolves higher costs and risk compared with other sectors. Loan sizes are small, reflecting the \nsmallholder-predominant modes of production across Ethiopia’s agricultural value chains. The cost \nof providing finance is high, driven by geographic distance, infrastructure gaps, low bank presence, \nfinancial illiteracy, and challenges complying with regulation and documentary requirements. High \nstructural risks emerge from seasonality, cyclicality, and the volatility of climate, price and financial \nsector credit availability, which remain difficult to mitigate. Furthermore, agricultural borrowers tend \nnot to possess the types of collateral typically accepted by financial institutions (FIs). Conversely, \nmany FIs do not have the specialized agricultural-financing knowledge or offer the tailored products \nrequired to sustainably finance the sector. \nSignificant investments have been made over recent years by the government, development \npartners and the private sector to address these challenges and build Ethiopia’s agri-finance \nlandscape. Registries have been developed by NBE and the Ministries of Agriculture (MoA), and \nTrade and Regional Integration (MoTRI) so that agricultural assets can serve as loan collateral to \nfulfil key agri-finance use cases. Regulations and cross-cutting financial and digital infrastructure \nhave been introduced, such as the credit reference bureau (CRB), the national identity scheme \n(National ID), and frameworks for capital goods financing, contract farming and integrated agro-\nindustrial parks (IAIPs). MoA has established a rural finance unit and is developing an ‘agri-stack’ \nto digitize and integrate agricultural functions and services under the ministry’s Digital Agriculture \nRoadmap 2032. The Ethiopian Cooperatives Commission (ECC) has worked to strengthen rural FIs, \nsupported by the Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI), which has launched an extensive array \nof initiatives to build foundations for access to agri-finance and rural financial inclusion. Significant \nmulti-stakeholder programmatic efforts have improved crop and livestock insurance in the country. \nAgri-finance has also been positively impacted by the emergence of agriculture finance technology \n(agfintech’) platforms such as Lersha and Kifiya, which help FIs to overcome the physical barriers \nof financing agriculture, as well as digital platforms that connect farmers to essential services, like \nMastercard Farm Pass.\nHowever, even when all these investments come to maturity, key structural and coordination \nconstraints are still likely to hold back the scale-up of agri-finance to meet policy ambitions. \n2  ETB 125 billion of agri-finance for financial year 2024 comprises ETB 107 billion of agri-finance reported by banks (of which CBE \nfertiliser finance is understood to account for approximately ETB 72 billion), ETB 4 billion from MFIs and ETB 13 billion from saving \nand credit cooperatives (SACCOs). If the CBE fertiliser finance is excluded from this total, for reasons set out in footnote 1, total \nagri-finance would stand at ETB 52 billion\n3\t  This total potential demand opportunity represents a scenario of modernized agriculture and comprises the key agri-finance use \ncases in which producers access credit to purchase crop and livestock inputs, irrigation, equipment and mechanization services, \nand use output finance to support enhanced aggregation and marketing.\n4\t  Subsistence farmers; smallholder farmers; pastoralists; semi-commercial and commercial farmers.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n12\n• \nStructural constraints represent missing parts of the agri-finance landscape and include: \no \nQuantitative and cyclical limitations on the loanable funds available for FI agri-lending, \nreflective of economy-wide credit constraints in which demand for finance far outstrips \nsupply. \no \nSpecific disincentives for financing agriculture compared with other sectors driven by \nthe high costs and risks of financing farmers. \no \nCompliance bottlenecks as producers struggle to meet regulatory and documentary \nrequirements, driving weeks if not months of time-consuming and resource-intensive \neffort by both producers and FI to approve and disburse a loan. \n• \nCoordination constraints do not represent an absence of activity but rather inadequate \ncoordination to drive sustainable, nationally scalable impact. These limitations have been \nidentified in the following areas: \no \nBuilding the financial literacy of agri-borrowers. \no \nDeveloping agricultural risk management frameworks. \no \nBuilding integration and institutional linkages between agri-finance actors5. \nAs Ethiopia rebalances its economy towards greater private sector participation, the agri-\nfinance outlook is challenging, with current trajectories trending negative. Agri-lending by \nthe historic private banks – those established prior to 2021 – has remained range-bound within \n1-3 percent of total credit supply. There has been a declining trend in the microfinance sector \nover the last four years that has seen the proportion of credit provided to agriculture fall from 30 \npercent to 18 percent. The drop was even more pronounced for those MFIs that converted to banks \nbetween 2021-22. Between them, Tsedey, Siinqee, Omo and Shabelle Banks experienced a fall in \nthe proportion of lending they made to agriculture from 57 percent to 32 percent in just one year.\nDespite the importance of financing agriculture, and the sizable challenges there are to scaling \nthe sector’s financial support and services, no over-arching strategy is in place to coordinate \nstakeholder actions across Ethiopia’s agri-finance landscape. Initiatives are fragmented under \nthe auspices of different institutions. There is limited data captured or monitored to provide insights \non the evolving status of agri-finance in the country. And there has not been a systematic effort to \ncoordinate actions across the different stakeholders involved.\nIn this context, the rationale for developing a national agri-finance implementation roadmap is \ntherefore to:\n• \nDevelop an over-arching strategy to integrate and energize Ethiopia’s developing agri-finance \nlandscape and resolve remaining constraints through transformative solutions.\n• \nBuild a comprehensive database to establish a baseline of relevant indicators and monitor \nprogress going forward towards achieving national policy targets.\n• \nPut in place a coordinating mechanism for joined-up multi-stakeholder action. \nVISION AND SOLUTIONS\nDrawing on African and international experience, three ‘game-changing’ solutions are \nproposed as the pillars of NAFIR for short-term impact that will resolve the remaining \nconstraints to agri-finance scale-up within a dynamic, specialised, digitalised and data-driven \nagri-finance landscape:\n• National Agri-Finance Accelerator (NAFA): This is a refinancing and risk-sharing vehicle that \nmakes available loanable funds earmarked specifically for agriculture and reduces the risk of \nlending to the agricultural sector. \n5\t  This includes between commercial banks and rural FIs, domestic and foreign institutions in the context of the opening of the \nbanking sector, and FIs and new and emerging digital platforms that hold the potential to overcome key barriers to financial \ninclusion in the agricultural sector.\n\n13\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n• Farmer Access to Streamlined Financial Services (FAST): This is an efficient interface for FIs \nto access farmer information, and for the farmer to access credit, streamlining compliance and \nreducing the cost of lending to the agricultural sector.\n• Agri-Finance Centre of Excellence (CoE): This is a hub for the sustainable, nationally scalable, \ncoordination of efforts to build borrowers’ financial literacy, FIs’ capacity, institutional linkages, \nand agricultural risk management solutions.  These undertakings will be integrated efficiently \nand cost-effectively into the NAFIR implementation process through strategic and coherent \nlong-term frameworks.\nNAFIR\nScaling up Agri-Finance in Ethiopia\nNBE AGRI-FINANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\nDYNAMIC, SPECIALISED, DIGITALIZED AND DATA-DRIVEN AGRI-FINANCE LANDSCAPE\nDeepening Financial \nInclusion\nReﬁnancing and Risk-Sharing \nMechanism\nFarmer Access to Credit, \nSavings and Payments\nHub for coordination of \nStrategic Long-Term \nFrameworks\n•\nIncrease loanable funds for \nagriculture\n•\nReduce risk of ﬁnancing \nagriculture\n•\nCreates incentives for \nagri-lending\n•\nEnsure credit gets where it \nis needed and no-one gets \nlef behind \n•\nStreamlines FI farmer loan \ncompliance\n•\nReduce cost of ﬁnancing \nagriculture\n•\nBuilds comprehensive \nfarmer proﬁles\n•\n Integrates and makes \ntraceable the value chain\n•\nBuilds ﬁnancial literacy of \nborrowers\n•\nBuilds institutional capacity \nof FIs\n•\nFacilitates institutional \nlinkages\n•\nStrengthens agricultural risk \nmanagement \nModernizing \nAgriculture\nStrengthening Sectoral\nLinkage\nValue Addition & Export \nGrowth\nPILLAR I: NAFA\nPILLAR II: FAST\nPILLAR III: CoE\nThe framework that emerges offers a holistic, data -driven, incentives-based approach across its \nthree pillars. Pillars I and II address the identified structural constraints: NAFA increases loanable \nfund availability and reduces the risk of lending to agriculture; FAST streamlines compliance and \nreduces the costs of financing the sector; and CoE addresses the identified coordination constraints, \nbuilding the financial literacy of borrowers and the institutional capacity of lenders, addressing both \nthe demand- and supply-sides of the agri-finance landscape. \n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n14\nA new policy instrument to further incentivize lending to agriculture may be considered subject to \nfurther assessment6.\n PILLAR I - NAFA: \nThe refinancing component of NAFA is designed to make available a new source of loanable \nfunds for FIs under an inclusive targeting framework. NAFA would act as a conduit for pooling \nresources from government, development partners and private sources. It would channel the \npooled resources to ensure that they not only reach agriculture, but also that credit is available for \nthe sub-segments where it is needed the most – agri-borrower types, use cases, value chains, \nregions, gender, and insurance – to make sure no one is left behind. Agri-lending would be \nstrengthened by the application of consistent definitions and the tagging of loans by identified \nsub-segments through NAFA. NAFA will implement and scale incrementally based on ‘test and \nlearn’ cycles targeting identified agricultural sub-sectors and regions meeting defined readiness \ncriteria.\nThis approach is structured to crowd in and scale up private sector funding for agriculture, \nin line with the HGER policy emphasis for Ethiopia’s transition to a private sector-led growth \nmodel. When a FI originates an agri-loan that qualifies for refinancing and risk-sharing incentives \nthrough NAFA by addressing under-served segments defined in the inclusive targeting framework, \nthe FI refinances that loan by selling a portion of it to NAFA. That portion of the loan capital is \nthen received back by the FI and becomes available for originating new loans. The result is a risk-\nsharing arrangement in which NAFA bears the risk for the portion of the loan that it refinances, and \npotentially more. It is proposed that NAFA may also take a first-loss position for loans provided to \nhigh priority and underserved segments through credit guarantee. Selective pre-financing (credit \nlines) may also be offered as an additional incentive to reach under-served segments, subject to an \norganized and ready pipeline of validated borrowers (e.g., a contract farming scheme)7. \nNAFA uses a data-driven, incentives-based approach for increasing the flow of credit not \nmerely to agriculture overall, but also to ensure that it reaches the under-served segments \nwhere it is needed the most.\n6\t  This would take note that, while there is a 5 percent minimum requirement for lending against movable assets already in place, less \nthan 1 percent of assets registered in Ethiopia’s Movable Property Security Registry are agricultural assets. Learning lessons from \ninternational experience, it is recommended that a minimum agri-credit lending requirement, if introduced, would create maximum \nflexibility in how FIs could fulfil the requirement. FIs may on-lend through other FIs. They may provide credit that is intermediated \nvia, for example, cooperatives, off-takers, agro-dealers, aggregators, warehouse operators, commodity exchanges, mobile money \nand agfintech platforms. They may purchase loans from other FIs whose loan value exceeds the requirement and so have a \nsurplus. This would create a market-based incentive for FIs to aim as high as possible with their agri-loans and not stop once they \nreach the minimum requirement, spurring some FIs to specialize in agri-finance and boost their rural presence, knowing these \ninvestments would be rewarded.\n7\t  A key risk with pre-financing is that funds allocated under a credit line may only be utilized slowly or not at all. In the context of \nEthiopia’s high systemic credit constraints, it is essential every birr of additional funding for agriculture is put to work. It is therefore \nrecommended that credit lines are provided on an exceptional basis for particularly underserved segments, not as the norm, and \nonly when the pipeline is already in place to allow for rapid disbursement. \nHypothetical Examples – How incentive levers may be used to stimulate the flow of agri-finance to under-\nserved segments.\nHypothetical Example 1:  \nCommercial cash crop farmer near Addis Ababa: 10 percent refinancing at refinancing base interest rate, with no \nrisk sharing. \nHypothetical Example 2: \nSmallholder grain farmer in rural center (e.g., Arsi): 50 percent refinancing at refinancing base rate minus 20 \npercent, with 75 percent risk share. \nHypothetical Example 3: \nLowland pastoralist: 75 percent refinancing at refinancing base rate minus 50 percent, with 80 percent first loss\n\n15\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n‘Levers’ that may incentivize the distribution of agri-finance to underserved segments include8:\n• \nA higher proportion of the total loan amount refinanced.\n• \nLower cost of refinancing.\n• \nFull or part prefinancing through credit lines.\n• \nLower cost of prefinancing.\n• \nA higher level of risk sharing.\n• \nFirst loss versus “pari-passu” (equal sharing) risk position.\nIn addition, FI agri-finance performance would be closely monitored with high-performing FIs \nand innovators recognized in an annual awards ceremony and rewarded with preferences – e.g., \nthrough government and development partner financing and project opportunities.\nAs agri-finance ecosystems mature, the proportion of credit provided direct by FIs to farmers \ntends to reduce as FIs use innovative channels to reach the farmer and overcome rural \ninfrastructure gaps.Therefore, while loans refinanced by NAFA may originate from FIs that loaned \ndirectly to the farmer, the FIs will also be encouraged to provide finance indirectly through on-\nlending or pass-through arrangements via available channels. These include: \n• \nOff-takers linked to contract farming arrangements to enable the financing of the farmer \nthrough their value chain relationships. \n• \nDigital platforms e.g., the Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI) input e-voucher system \n(IVS), mobile money (e.g., TeleBirr/MPESA), and agfintech and digital platforms (e.g., Kifiya/\nLersha/ Farm Pass). \n• \nInput distributors, such as cooperatives, agro-dealers, or ATI agricultural one-stop shops \n(AOSS), which may provide farmers with crop inputs, animal feed and health products on credit. \n• \nEquipment vendors or mechanization service providers, which may provide goods and \nservices to the farmers on credit. \n• \nWarehouse operators that may disburse credit to the farmer on behalf of the FI, secured \nagainst the farmer’s outputs stored in a professionally managed warehouse.\nFIs benefitting from NAFA refinancing and risk-sharing would meet eligibility requirements \nin line with good practice to ensure sustainability and impact. These would include meeting \nminimum requirements for specialised agri-finance product design, emphasis on promoting \nagricultural assets as movable collateral as well as use of alternative data, robust loan lifecycle \nprocedures, and the application of fair commercially-based interest rates and fees to assure the \naffordability of credit for the farmer. These requirements would create incentives for FIs to design \nspecialised, farmer-inclusive and competitive agri-finance products backed by dedicated  in-house \nagri-finance capability, supported with the provision of capacity-building services by the CoE (see \nbelow) \nNAFA would be integrated closely with the existing components of Ethiopia’s agri-finance \nlandscape for a coordinated scale-up of credit to meet policy ambitions. NAFA Integration \nand Scalability Plans would be developed by the ‘landscape enablers’ – registries, initiatives, and \nprograms – across both the financial and real sectors, which drives the fulfilment of each agri-\nfinance use case. These would set out the actions required from each landscape enabler to build the \nnecessary capacity so the landscape can support more farmers, more transactions, more locations, \nand more value chains. \n8\t  The levers may be adjusted to optimize agri-finance distribution based on continuous analysis of the elasticities and cross-\nelasticities of agri-credit provision in response to changes in one or more of these levers for a given agri-borrower type.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n16\nNAFA is intended as a time-bound approach to catalyze the initial scale-up, while accompanied \nby longer-term measures that further increase the availability of loanable funds for agriculture \nover time. A ratings system for FIs and the cooperative sector would create transparency and \nstrengthen readiness for taking on agri-finance-earmarked credit lines. Inter-bank markets would \nenable the trading of available loanable funds for agri-credit among FIs, so these funds reach those \ninstitutions best placed to originate new agri-loans. Agro-securitization would be developed via the \nEthiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) to facilitate access to funds from the capital markets. \nThe combination of refinancing with risk-sharing through NAFA has been recommended over \nother possible approaches. Alternatives include: \n•\t\nAn agri policy bank may result in the centralization of agri-credit supply, crowding out the \nprivate sector, and dampening the dynamism and innovation that results from competition, as \nwell as sectoral concentration that may challenge risk management and prudent operation best \npractices. However, there is scope over time for a specialised agri-bank to be introduced on \na fully commercial basis, including as a public-private partnership blending government and \nprivate sector investment.\n•\t\nA national risk-sharing facility, which as a standalone approach would not address the constraint \nin loanable fund access that holds back the scale-up of FI credit flows to agriculture. \n•\t\nRelying on FIs to source their own credit lines and risk-sharing facilities, which is important and \nwill be supported through NAFIR. However, it would not – as a short-term standalone measure \n– result in a systematic and coordinated solution to ensure sufficient capital is raised to meet \nnational policy targets or that credit reaches where it is needed most to make sure that no one \ngets left behind. \n PILLAR II - FAST\nFAST is a mechanism for rapid farmer access to financial services via a mix of mediums \nthat may include physical or digital credit cards, QR codes, agent-based and other offline \nsolutions applicable to context. A FAST unique identifier would be linked to a named farmer, \nFayda ID number, farm plot and/or tagged livestock in MoA databases, cellphone number where \navailable, and provide a digital wallet for the farmer to facilitate digital payments for goods and \nservices, receive sales proceeds, and make savings. The use of agent-based access models would \novercome digital literacy gaps, combined with an extensive financial and digital literacy training \nframework to accompany rollout. Presentation by the farmer of their FAST or Fayda identifier to a \nFI would allow immediate access to all relevant information the FI requires to issue a loan to that \nfarmer, per NBE regulatory frameworks to be updated. The aim is to cut out entirely the need for \nfarmers to submit compliance documentation to the FI, eliminating large amounts of paperwork, \nprocessing effort, and time delays.\nThe implementation of FAST would be managed in partnership with the National ID, MoA, ATI \nand ECC, closely linked to the imminent rural roll-out of National ID. National ID is responsible \nfor issuing the Fayda unique identifier along with physical and digital cards. It will shortly commence \nits rural rollout, reaching millions of farmers during 2025 itself and tens of millions in 2026 and \nsubsequent years. National ID has already integrated with the MoA’s land registry database, which \nis understood to cover 18 million farmers, linking the Fayda unique identifier with essential farm \ndata such as geolocation, plot size and crop mix. National ID will also shortly introduce a digital \ncredentials wallet that allows for a farmer’s FAST unique identifier credential to sit alongside the \nFayda identifier and others (e.g., driving licenses, social protection credentials) offering a readily \naccessible and interoperable technology backbone for implementation of FAST. The MoA will \nalso play an important role building the real sector’s enabling environment for scaling up agri-\n\n17\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nfinance, while ATI, through agricultural commercialization clusters (ACC), AOSSs, the IVS, and the \n8028-farmer hotline. In addition, ECC will help integrate FAST with efficient ‘last mile’ delivery \nsystems for inputs, equipment and mechanization services that reach the farmer even in remote \nrural areas. \nAn automated, centrally developed credit-scoring algorithm would generate a personalized \nseasonal credit allowance for each farmer, linked to their FAST identifier. The algorithm would \nbe jointly developed by the FIs under NBE auspices, like the way in which FIs collaborated with \nmobile money platforms to develop credit-scoring algorithms embedded in those platforms to \nsupport digital micro-lending. The algorithm would calculate each farmer’s seasonal credit \nallowance according to the farmer’s need – based on factors such as farm plot size, crop mix and \nproduction cost – as well as market price and past performance to assess the affordability of credit. \nThe allowance would be sub-allocated to different use case ‘windows’ for crop inputs, irrigation, \nmechanization, livestock, outputs and insurance, and would be pre-cleared for NAFA refinancing \nand risk-sharing to closely link farmer access with FI incentive. A fund allocation for non-farm and \nhousehold purposes may also be provided, recognizing that many producer households engage in \nnon-agricultural activities. Gender-intentionality would be incorporated into the credit allocations, \nrecognizing the specific needs and challenges facing women farmers.\nAs a condition of access to credit through FAST, crop or livestock insurance would automatically \nbe taken for the farmer. This would enable the bundling of insurance with credit, refinanced by \nNAFA on a risk-sharing basis, and repaid out of the farmer’s sales proceeds along with other credit \nthe farmer takes via FAST. As a result, crop and livestock insurance would become more affordable \nfor the farmer and create the conditions for significant growth in farmer uptake, with the economies \nof scale and efficiencies of distribution driving a potential reduction in premium costs, and with a \nstrategy in place to systematically raise awareness and provide education to farmers. \nAlso, as a condition of access to credit through FAST, the farmer would need to use their FAST \nidentifier when making or receiving digital payments related to agro-input, mechanization, \nand output transactions. \nThe use of FAST for procuring agro-inputs and mechanization equipment or services would provide \nassurance that the farmer is using credit for the intended purposes and create an audit trail of the \nfarmer’s input and equipment use over time. \nThe use of FAST to receive the sales proceeds from the farmer’s output marketing would enable \nloan repayments to be deducted from the farmer’s sales proceeds and create an audit trail of the \nfarmer’s marketable surplus and income over time. \nWith the farmer’s output marketing transactions systematically recorded, FAST would create \ntraceability of the flow of goods along the value chain. In so doing, FAST would also serve \nto deter and detect ‘side-selling’ against contract farming commitments, providing stimulus for \ncontract farming and related value chain finance (VCF)-based lending. This would help to strengthen \nvalue chain relationships, integrate farmers into the formal economy, and provide opportunities for \ndigitalizing revenue collection by government linked to the ‘Digital Ethiopia 2025’ national digital \ntransformation strategy. To strengthen sectoral linkages between agriculture and industry and \ncreate the absorptive capacity for the offtake of increased farm-level output, a special provision for \nNAFA refinancing and risk-sharing would be made for loans to off-takers that participate in contract \nfarming arrangements and IAIPs. This would create incentives for closer relationships between \nproducers and off-takers and create a stimulus for value addition and export growth.\nData from FAST would feed into a National Agri-Finance Database (NAFID), building \na comprehensive profile for each farmer to drive bankability and a surge in farm-level \ninvestment. This profile would comprise farmer identity, farm data, marketing track record, and \n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n18\nfinancial history. Over time, on-farm monitoring that measures farm performance (productivity, \nwater efficiency, PHL) would also feed into NAFID, enabling the comprehensive tracking of progress \ntowards agricultural modernization by value chain and region. Importantly, the NAFID database, \nand the data-sharing protocols linked to it, would be protected by best practice data security and \nconsumer protection frameworks.\nPILLAR III – COE\nThe CoE is intended as a hub for stakeholder coordination, implementation and monitoring \nin the areas of financial literacy, FI capacity development, agricultural risk management and \nFI linkages. Its purpose is to supersede approaches that in the past may have been fragmented, \nsmall scale and program-specific with strategic and coherent frameworks that are systematic, \ncoordinated, and have long-term continuity backed by a technical assistance facility.\nThe CoE may be structured to have regional outreach to cover the country as a whole, and would \nbe tasked with four action areas:\nNational Agri-Finance Literacy (NAFIL) Framework: The CoE would oversee the development \nand delivery of a national framework for agri-financial and related digital literacy, under the \nNational Financial Education Strategy (NFES). NAFIL would include, among other things, a \nsegmented stakeholder needs assessment, a gap analysis, and the scoping and development of \nrelevant content necessary to build the financial and digital literacy of producers and cooperatives \nto successfully absorb and put to effective use agri-finance across the different use cases and \nvalue chains. NAFIL would be delivered smartly to farmers and cooperatives by integrating it with \nthe rollout of NAFA and FAST, in partnership with MoA, ECC, and ATI, to improve efficiency, \ninclusiveness, and cost-effectiveness.\nFI and Regulatory Capacity Development: The CoE would support FIs to introduce specialised \nagri-finance products and build up their in-house specialised agri-finance capability by developing \nbest practice principles, guidelines and templates, backed by training and capacity-building \nservices. It would also support FI development of Interest Free Banking (IFB) equivalent agri-finance \nproducts to address the needs of Muslim borrowers. The CoE would run competitions to stimulate \nagri-finance and agfintech innovations, providing technical support for early implementation and \nrelated capacity-building. Importantly, the CoE would offer differentiated approaches by FI type, \nand enable a renewed focus on agri-finance by the MFI sector, as well as the converted MFIs \nnow licensed as banks, so the proportion of MFI credit provided to agriculture may reverse its \ncurrent downward trajectory. Special provision would be made for capacity-building to financial \nsector regulatory authorities to ensure adequate knowledge, understanding and skills are in place \nto effectively regulate the new environment.\nHub for Agri-Finance Institutional Linkages (HAFIL): The CoE would build improved access for \nEthiopian FIs to credit lines from international sources, and for MFIs and rural savings and credit \ncooperatives (RuSACCOs) to credit lines and on-lending facilities from banks. A further linkage \nfacilitated by HAFIL would be between FIs and digital platforms, including mobile money and \nagfintech platforms, to drive forward digital transformation in agriculture. The CoE’s role would be \nto facilitate partnerships, disseminate information, study and share best practices, and monitor progress.\nAgriculture Risk Management: An Agriculture Risk Management Permanent Working Group \nunder the CoE would be formed which would cohesively address the range of challenges facing \nthe scale-up of agricultural insurance in the country, including policy, regulation, strategy, capacity, \nproduct design, distribution and cost: The Working Group would have two broad objectives:\n\t\n■\nTo integrate crop and livestock insurance within the NAFA/FAST framework. This would \nenable the bundling of insurance with credit, refinanced by NAFA, and repaid out of the farmer’s \nsales proceeds along with other credit the farmer takes via FAST. As a result, crop and livestock \n\n19\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\ninsurance would become more affordable for the farmer and create the conditions needed for \nimproved farmer uptake. \n\t\n■\nTo develop and implement a national policy framework and strategy for agricultural \nrisk management, including components on crop and livestock insurance, and price risk \nmanagement. Under this workstream: \no \nThe initial focus will be to continue scaling up crop and livestock insurance, building on the \nfour dialogue platform meetings that took place under the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) Index based Crop Insurance development project between May 2022 and \nJanuary 2024, while linking to ongoing initiatives such as the Integrated and Risk Finance \nFacility (IRFF)9 and Africa Risk Capacity (ARC)10, and addressing new developments including \nthe prospective establishment of an insurance regulator, and enhancing the institutional \ndistribution arrangements for insurance in the country. \no \nThe medium-term focus would be developing a framework for price risk management. Price \nrisk management solutions are not yet available in Ethiopia, even though FIs cite price volatility \nas a significant risk that constrains agri-lending. An agricultural price risk management \nstrategy would be developed under which solutions would be gradually introduced, such as \nhedging tools offered by domestic and international commodity exchanges, and actuarial \nsolutions.\nGOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION\nNAFIR will be implemented in close partnership with the institutions supporting the key \ncomponents of Ethiopia’s agri-finance landscape across both the financial and real sectors. \nNAFA will be funded through a resource mobilization strategy based on a follow-up readiness \nassessment, including through use of NAFA for channelling government support to farmers in \na sustainable and catalytic framework. Funds for NAFA implementation may be sourced from \ngovernment, development partners, and private sources, and may encompass in-kind as well \nas cash contributions. FAST will be implemented in partnership with the National ID, MoA, ATI, \nand ECC, and interface with digital platforms (e.g., agfintech platforms, Farm Pass), based on \nregulations for credit provision through FAST. The CoE will be delivered in partnership with the \nEthiopian Institute for Financial Studies, MoA, ATI and ECC, and in collaboration with global centers \nof excellence.\nGovernance of NAFIR implementation is recommended to take place through a steering \ncommittee co-chaired by the Governor of the NBE and the Minister of Agriculture. \nThis mechanism will convene the key institutional actors supporting agri-finance in Ethiopia \nand is intended to drive a whole-of-government approach. A technical sub-committee \nwould sit under the steering committee. The steering committee would also oversee a project \nmanagement unit housed initially within the NBE to facilitate implementation. A NAFIR \nconsultative body would comprise demand- and supply-side stakeholders, development \npartners, and experts from academia and technical institutions. It would meet with the steering \ncommittee on a regular basis to review the progress of NAFIR and identify enhancements. \nThe key NAFIR target is the TYDP policy target of ETB 881 billion per annum credit flow \nto agriculture by 2030. Further scale-up to fulfil larger portions of total agri-finance potential \ndemand may be considered for a potential second NAFIR covering the period 2031-2035. A full \nresults framework and implementation plan has been developed and will be updated based on pre \nimplementation readiness studies.\n9\t  IRFF is a collaboration between MoA and the United Nations Development Program.\n10\t  ARC is a specialized agency of the African Union, which is rolling out parametric insurance services to member states and farmers \nvia innovative financing mechanisms that pool disaster-related risk across Africa and transfer it to international risk markets.

The \nsector contributes 32% to Ethiopia’s GDP, 64% to employment and 79% to exports11. Of this, crops \ncontribute approximately 60% of agricultural GDP, and livestock contributes 27%12. \nEthiopian agriculture is characterised by the predominance of smallholder family farms. \nSmallholder farmers account for approximately 95% of Ethiopia’s land under cultivation and 90% \nof total agricultural output13. 88% of Ethiopia’s poor live in the rural areas and are engaged in \nagriculture14.\nFarming practices remain undeveloped in the country. Most smallholder production is rainfed, \nusing traditional technologies, and involves minimal integration between primary production and the \ndownstream agro-industries. Value chains tend to be characterised by multiple layers of non-value-\nadding intermediaries transacting informally via cash-based transactions, although the massive \nscale-up of digital finance in recent years is likely to spur significant change. A large majority \nof Ethiopia’s exports comprise raw or primary processed agricultural commodities with limited \nvalue addition performed onshore. In this context, financial inclusion, agricultural modernisation, \nstrengthening sectoral linkages between agriculture and industry, value addition and export growth \nare key national policy objectives.\n1.2 RATIONALE FOR A NATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE ROADMAP (NAFIR)\nAgri-finance is a key enabler of achieving these policy objectives. \nImproved access to financial services is a necessary condition for scaling investment in \nprimary production and along the value chain. Producers need credit to boost productivity, \nexpand farm size, reduce PHL, diversify production, strengthen livelihoods including for women \nand youth farmers, and build climate adaptation and resilience. Agri-finance is also a necessary \ncondition for strengthening aggregation and supply of agricultural raw materials to downstream \nagro-industries, and for mitigating the structural risks faced by Ethiopia’s agricultural value chains \nthat result from exposure to the volatilities of climate, price and financial sector credit availability.\nHowever, agriculture is significantly under-financed in Ethiopia.  In 2023-24, credit flows to \nagriculture represented 8% of loans disbursed by banks (24%, including CBE fertiliser finance) and \n18% of loans outstanding from MFIs. As previously noted, this compares with the 32% contribution \nthat agriculture makes to Ethiopia’s GDP, 64% to employment and 79% to exports. Per African \nDevelopment Bank (AfDB) analysis, credit constraints impact over two-thirds of Ethiopia’s smallholder \nfarmers15. Alleviating these constraints could drive national productivity gain over 60%16.\nNBE defines agricultural credit as lending to “business that includes cultivating soil, producing crops, \nraising livestock, bee-keeping, fishery and other related activities”(NBE Directive No. MFI/24/2013). \nThe large-scale fertiliser financing scheme funded by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) is \none major source of financing that falls under the ‘other related activities’. Under this arrangement, \nsignificant quantities of fertiliser are imported and distribued to rural areas through regional \ngovernments and cooperatives. Without this scheme, farmers may not have access to fertiliser. \nHowever, the scheme does not result in the provision of credit to primary producers as the end \n11\t  NBE 2022/23 - agriculture contribution to GDP and exports; World Bank 2020 – agriculture contribution to employment. \n12\t  National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP), 2021-30\n13\t  Ibid\n14\t  World Bank (2020).

Yet this finance \naccounts for nearly 70% of total reported agri-loan disbursement for 2023/24. For purposes of the \nanalysis in this document, the report quotes agri-finance statistics that may include or exclude the \nCBE fertiliser finance, according to context, and as stated in the text. It is emphasised, the same \nunderlying official data has been used in all cases, and any difference versus official NBE data and \npublications stems from the statistics in which the CBE fertiliser finance has been excluded.\nAnalysis performed in the development of NAFIR suggests that as little as 5% of the total \nnational demand opportunity for agri-finance is currently fulfilled (2% excluding CBE fertiliser \nfinance). Per the 2023-24 official data, agri-loans of Ethiopian Birr (ETB) 125  billion per annum \n(ETB 52 billion, excluding CBE fertiliser finance) was supplied against the total annual potential \ndemand opportunity of ETB 2,582 billion per annum17. This total annual potential demand \nopportunity represents a scenario of fully modernised agriculture and comprises the key agri-\nfinance use cases for which producers across Ethiopia’s agricultural value chains would access \ncredit for crop and livestock inputs, irrigation, equipment and mechanisation services, and use \noutput finance to support enhanced aggregation and marketing. \nIt is noted that this demand for agri-finance is not all required at the same time but rather over \nthe course of the season during production and post-harvest activities. Therefore, the loanable \nfunds requirement to fulfil the annual demand opportunity is substantially lower than the demand \nopportunity itself. The total annual potential demand opportunity comprises crop inputs (ETB 330 \nb/annum), irrigation (ETB 69 b/annum), mechanisation (ETB 86 b/annum) and outputs (ETB 1,186 b/\nannum). Demand for finance from the livestock sector is also significant, comprising annual material \ncosts of production (ETB 887 b/annum) and stock replenishment (ETB 22 b/annum). The total \npotential demand opportunity for agri-finance is projected to grow to ETB 2,928 billion by 203018.\nCharts 1-2: Agri-Finance Potential Annual Demand Opportunity by Use Case & Sector \n(ETB billions, 2024)\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\nOutputs\n1,186\n889\n330\n86\n69\n22\n2,582\nAnimals (annual)\nInputs\nMechanisation\nIrrigation\nAnimals (Stock)\nTotal\n-\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\nLivestock\nGrains\nHorticulture\nCoﬀee/tea\nPulses\nOilseeds\nFibre\nSpices\nSugar\nApiculture\nOther\nTotal\n911\n789\n592\n117\n83\n51\n18\n16\n5\n1\n0\n2,582\n-\nSource: Author (See Chapter Three for methodology)\n17\t  ETB 125 billion of agri-finance for financial year 2024 comprises ETB 107 billion of agri-finance reported by banks (of which CBE \nfertiliser finance is understood to account for approximately ETB 72 billion), ETB 4 billion from MFIs and ETB 13 billion from saving \nand credit cooperatives (SACCOs). If the CBE fertiliser finance is excluded from this total, for reasons set out in footnote 1 above, \ntotal agri-finance would stand at ETB 52 billion\n18\t  This is driven by area (crops) and animal stock (livestock) growth only. Prices have been held constant at 2023/24 levels.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n24\nAs Ethiopia rebalances its economy towards greater private sector participation, the outlook \nfor agri-finance looks challenging with current trajectories trending negative. Agri-lending by \nthe historic private banks – those established prior to 2021 – has remained range-bound at just \n1-3% of their total credit supply. There has been a declining trend in the microfinance sector over \nthe last four years which has seen their proportion of credit provided to agriculture fall from 30% \nto 18%. The drop was even more pronounced for those MFIs which converted to become banks \nbetween 2021-22. Between them, Tsedey, Siinqee, Omo and Shabelle Banks experienced a fall in \nthe proportion of lending to agriculture from 57% to 32% in just one year.\nCharts 3-5 Agricultural Loans, 2020-24 (ETB millions, %) – Historic Banks, Converted Banks, MFIs\nChart 3: \n‘Traditional’ private bank lending to agriculture, 2020-24\nChart 4: \nConverted MFI bank lending to agriculture, 2020-24\nChart 5: \nMFI lending to agriculture, 2020-24\nAgri \n%\n350,000\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2020\n2021\n11,082\n1,027\n1,192\n1%\n2%\n1%\n3%\n1%\n3,225\n8,218\n2,543\n25,965\n57%\n30%\n29%\n26%\n22%\n18%\n32%\n36%\n22,547\n2,937\n3,349\n3,827\n3,895\n4,093\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n0 %\n4 %\n8 %\n12 %\n16 %\n20 %\n-\n90,000\n80,000\n70,000\n60,000\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n-\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n-\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nAgri Loan \nDisbursement\nTotal Loan \nDisbursement\nAgri \n%\nAgri Loan \nDisbursement\nTotal Loan \nDisbursement\nAgri %\nMRI Agri Loan \nDisbursement\nMRI Bank Total Loan \nDisbursement\nSource: NBE\nThe causes of agricultural under-financing in Ethiopia are multi-faceted and well-\ndocumented19. Financing the agricultural sector involves higher cost and risk compared with \nthe manufacturing, industry and service sectors. Loan sizes are small, reflecting the smallholder-\npredominant modes of production across Ethiopia’s agricultural value chains. The cost of providing \nfinance is high, driven by geographic distance, infrastructure gaps, low bank presence, the \nfinancial illiteracy, and challenges complying with regulation and documentary requirements (see \nBox 1 below). In addition, many FIs do not have the specialised knowledge or offer the specialised \nagri-finance products required to sustainably finance the sector.\n19\t  See for example Gutierrez et al 2023 , ‘Agri Finance Navigator: A Snapshot of the Ethiopian Agri-SME Financing Ecosystem’, \nBIC Ethiopia; Elias and Beshir 2022, ‘Agricultural Finance and Insurance in Ethiopia; Challenges and Policy Options’, Ethiopian \nEconomics Association Policy Working Paper 08/2022; Schmidt and Engelhardt 2022, ‘Barriers to Agri-Finance in Ethiopia’, GIZ; \nBox 1: Practical Experiences Financing Smallholder Farmers in Ethiopia\nFinancial institutions that have engaged in pilot smallholder and MSME agri-financing schemes report \na large amount of laborious groundwork to comply with mandated know your client (KYC), credit and \nconsumer protection requirements. Farmer loan applications can take many weeks or months, requiring \nrepeat – and often fruitless – visits either by the bank to the borrower, or by the borrower to the bank.  \n\n25\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nHigh structural risks in agriculture emerge from seasonality, cyclicality and the volatilities of climate, \nprice and financial sector credit availability, which remain difficult to mitigate, while agricultural \nborrowers tend to lack possession of the types of collateral typically accepted by FIs. \nDespite the importance of agri-finance, and the sizable challenges it faces to scale-up, no over-\narching strategy is in place to coordinate stakeholder actions across Ethiopia’s agri-finance \nlandscape. Rather, initiatives are fragmented under the auspices of different institutions. There \nis limited data captured or monitored to provide insight on the evolving status of agri-finance in \nthe country. And there has not been a systematic effort to coordinate actions across the different \nstakeholders involved.\nIn this context, the rationale for developing a national agri-finance roadmap is therefore to:\n1. Develop an over-arching strategy to integrate and energise Ethiopia’s emergent agri-finance \nlandscape and resolve remaining constraints through transformative ‘game changing’ solutions.\n2. Build a comprehensive database to establish a baseline of relevant indicators and monitor \nprogress going forward towards achievement of national policy targets.\n3. Put in place a coordinating mechanism for joined-up multistakeholder action. \n1.3 STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT\nThe report continues in Chapter Two with the definitions and scope of agri-finance. \nIn Chapter Three, the methodology that has been used in the development of NAFIR is set out, \nalong with a review of the data used and of the analysis that has been conducted. \nChapter Four reviews the policy context ahead of Chapter Five which conducts a stock-taking of \nagri-finance in Ethiopia to date. Based on the stock-taking, and taking into account consultations \nwith stakeholders through engagement and survey, the emergent Ethiopian agri-finance landscape \nhas been mapped.\nChapter Six identifies gaps in the agri-finance landscape that constrain the scale-up necessary to \nmeet targets. Recommendations have been provided that address these gaps. \nChapter Seven presents the ‘game changers’ – transformative solutions to address the remaining \ngaps – packaged together as three pillars in a coherent overall NAFIR vision and strategy for \nintegrating and energising Ethiopia’s agri-finance landscape to drive the necessary scale-up. \nChapter Eight provides illustrations of how the NAFIR vision would work in practice under several \nscenarios. \nKey challenges include: obtaining documents from regional and woreda administrations, which often \nentails delays, inconsistencies, system challenges and lack of understanding; use of various local \nlanguages; variant spelling within and across these languages; obtaining consistent signatures; different \nnaming conventions;different marital structures; inefficient document renewal regimes; requirement for Tax \nIdentification Numbers (TIN) numbers which most farmers do not have; the high number of documents and \ncontracts that a borrower – often facing literacy and awareness challenges – needs to sign; and the need \nto obtain and navigate NBE exemptions and waivers for various parts of the above.\nSource: NAFIR Stakeholder Engagement and Survey\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n26\n\n27\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n2. \nAGRI-FINANCE\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n28\n2. AGRI-FINANCE: DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE\nFinance is taken to comprise four kinds of service – credit, savings, payments and insurance.\nAgriculture follows the NBE definition of agriculture as “business that includes cultivating soil, \nproducing crops, raising livestock, bee-keeping, fishery and other related activities” (NBE Directive \nNo. MFI/24/2013). Key agricultural sub-sectors include grains, pulses, horticulture, coffee/tea, \noilseeds, fattening, poultry, dairy, spices, fibres, apiculture, forestry and fisheries. \nChart 6: Ethiopia Agricultural Production Area by Sector (Average 2020-23, Million Hectares)\n12.0\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\nGrains\n10.4\n1.6\n1.0\n0.8\n0.7\n0.4\n0.3\n0.0\n0.0\nPulses\nHolticulture\nCoﬀee/tea\nOilseeds\nFibre\nSpices\nSugar\nOther\n-\nSource: FAOSTAT (crops only)\nNote: Teff is not included in FAOSTAT. Data has been sourced from Tiguh et al (2024), “Assessment of harvest and postharvest \nlosses of teff”, Heliyon 10 (9), based on Central Statistical Agency data.\nAgricultural finance (‘agri-finance’) denotes provision of financial services to a party engaged \nin primary production, i.e. farm-level activities, as well as related activities, in line with NBE’s \ndefinition as noted above20. \nRelated activities in this context may include:\nI\t\nIntermediated finance: \ni.e. finance that reaches primary producers \nvia sources which may include offtakers, \naggregators cooperatives, input suppliers, \nagro-dealers and equipment vendors\nII \nFinance for the downstream agricultural \nvalue chain: \ni.e. finance that supports the movement \nand transformation of goods along the \nagricultural value chain through actors \ninvolved \nin \naggregation, \nprimary \nand \nsecondary \nprocessing, \nmanufacturing, \ndistribution, retail and export. \nUse Cases: Within the context of smallholder production systems, there are five main purposes, \nor ‘use cases’, for which agricultural credit is typically provided. Each of these use cases can \ncontribute to solving the deep-rooted challenges faced by Ethiopian agriculture. As agri-\nfinancing ecosystems mature, each use case tends to be supported by specialised agri-finance \nloan products.\n20\t\n NBE Directive No. MFI/24/2013\nBox 2:\nEstimates suggest that in comparative contexts, \nas much as 30% of agri-finance may be \ndelivered through the value chain, and 45% \nthrough cooperatives and other rural institutions \n(IFC 2018)\nBox 3: \nNational policy frameworks recognise the need \nto strengthen sectoral linkages between primary \nagriculture and industry, Production gains that \nresult from agricultural modernisation require \nabsorptive capacity from the downstream value \nchain so that it leads to sustainable farm-level \ninvestment, livelihood gain and economic \ngrowth.\n\n29\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nTable 1: Agri-Finance Use Cases and their Impacts\nUse Case\nDescription\nImpact\nSpecialised Products\nInputs\nFunding the \nannual material \ncosts of \nproduction – \nseed, fertiliser, \nplant protection \nproducts, etc.\nIncreased inputs use \ncan boost agricultural \nproductivity and close \nEthiopia’s yield gap. \nEthiopian wheat yields of \n2.5 MT/ha stand at only \n30% of their 8.4 MT/ha \npotential, and maize yields \nstand at only 22% of their \npotential21. Higher yields \npositively impact farmer \nincome and livelihoods, \nfood security, import \nsubstitution, value addition \nand export.\nValue chain finance (VCF) \ninvolves structuring the loan \naround the farmer’s value chain \nrelationship, often linked to a  \ncontract farming scheme.\nCashflow-based lending (CBL) \nis a data-driven approach which \nmodels the farmers year-round \ncash flows and structures credit \naround them.\nCrop receipt finance involves \nthe farmer collateralising the loan \nwith the crops under production \nas reflected on a ‘crop receipt’.\nIrrigation\nFunding for \nthe costs of \nacquisition, \noperation and \nmaintenance of \nirrigation systems, \nwhich may \ninclude various \nkinds of pump, or \nalternative systems \nsuch as drip.\nIncreased use of irrigation \ncan build Ethiopia’s climate \nresilience while also \nboosting productivity \nthrough consistent water \nsupply enabling year-round \nproduction. Over 50% of \nEthiopia is drought-prone22, \nyet only 0.47% of total \nagricultural land is currently \nirrigated23.\nSmall asset finance in which \nloans are paid back from the \nincreased cashflows generated \nby irrigation/equipment usage, \nwith the equipment itself serving \nas collateral.\nPay-as-you-go financing, \ninvolves farmers paying for \nthe asset as and when they \naccrue cash. The asset may be \nremotely switched off or locked if \nminimum payments are not met. \nIn some schemes, payment of a \nsufficient sum over time results in \nthe transfer of asset ownership to \nthe farmer.\nLease-to-own finance is similar \nto pay-as-you-go, but usually has \na pre-specified lease schedule. \nMechanisation\nFunding for \nthe acquisition \nof equipment, \nor payment \nfor the use of \nmechanisation \nservices, in the \ncourse of primary \ncrop production \n(pre- and post-\nharvest) and \nlivestock raising.\nAccess to mechanisation \nassets and services can \ndrive the expansion of \nEthiopia’s area under \ncultivation from its current \nlevel of 14.5% of the total24. \nMechanisation can also \ncontribute to reduced \npost-harvest loss (PHL), \nwhich range between 20-\n30% for grains and 30-\n50% for horticulture25.\n21   Global Yield Gap Atlas\n22   Skoufias et al 2021, “Quantifying Vulnerability to Poverty in the Drought-Prone Lowlands of Ethiopia”, World Bank Policy \nResearch Working Paper 9534, drawing on Ethiopian Development Research Institute data\n23   World Bank Development Indicators 2020\n24   World Bank Development Indicators 2022\n25   Ministry of Agriculture, Postharvest Management Strategy of Ethiopia, 2024\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n30\nUse Case\nDescription\nImpact\nSpecialised Products\nOutputs\nFunding to provide \nliquidity \nwhich \nenables producers \nand \nproducer \norganisations \nto \nincur \nthe \ncarry \ncosts \n(storage, \nfinance) \nthat \nenable \ndeferred \nor forward sale, \nto \nfund \nvalue \naddition and other \nservices26.\nOutput finance empowers \nand \nremunerates \nthe \nfarmer to realise higher \nprices and income27, drives \naggregation efficiency by \nenabling the supply of raw \nmaterials faster, at higher \nscale and at lower cost to \nagro-industries and export \nmarkets, in turn driving \ncompetitiveness, \nand \nsupports increased use of \nstorage which smooths the \nflow of goods to market, \nreducing price volatility \nand PHL, while improving \nthe quality and safety of \nthe raw materials supplied.\nCollateralised \ncommodity \nfinance (CCF)28 involves the \nfarmer pledging goods deposited \nin a licensed warehouse as \ncollateral against a loan.\nSupply chain finance (SCF) \nsolutions create liquidity for the \nsuppliers of large buyers whose \ninvoices may be discounted to \naccess early payment.\nStructured \ntrade \nand \ncommodity finance (STCF)29 is \na form of self-liquidating trade \nfinance in which the sale of the \nfinanced asset results in the \nrepayment of the loan.\nLivestock \nFunding \nthe \nannual \nmaterial \ncosts of livestock \np r o d u c t i o n \nincluding \nanimal \nfeed and health \nproducts, \nas \nwell as the costs \nof \nreplenishing \nanimal stock.\nIncreased access to finance \nenables pastoralists to boost \nlivestock \nproductivity, \nnoting that Ethiopian egg. \nmilk and meat yields stand \nat 60-70% of the African \naverage and 50% of the \nglobal average (15% of the \nglobal average for milk)30.\nValue chain finance (VCF) in \nthe case of livestock involves \nstructuring \nthe \nloan \naround \nthe \nfarmer’s \nvalue \nchain \nrelationship with, e.g. a dairy or \nslaughterhouse.\nSmall asset finance in which the \nanimal serves as collateral, and \nthe credit amount and repay-\nments are structured according \nto the cashflows\nIn addition, payments, savings and insurance solutions form an important part of the agri-\nfinance product mix. FI-delivered payment solutions tend to be more efficient than cash-based \ntransactions. They enable producers to convert farm profits much faster and more reliably into \nlivelihood gain and on-farm investment. Savings and insurance solutions strengthen the resilience of \nfarming to the volatilities and shocks to which producers are exposed. By mitigating key credit risks \nthat can impair loan performance, savings and insurance products help to improve the bankability \nof agricultural producers.\n26   In the context of long, informal value chains, output finance typically flows to value chain intermediaries or offtakers enabling \nthem to fund the aggregation of outputs from primary producers.  \n27   IFC-supported warehouse receipt system (WRS) pilots in 2020/21 demonstrated that farmers can receive over 20% higher \nincome from use of storage, net of the costs of storage and finance.\n28   Also known as warehouse receipt finance (WRF) or inventory finance \n29   Also known as trade finance, commodity finance and structured commodity finance\n30   FAOSTAT, with milk yield sourced from Temesgen et al (2023), ‘Exploring policy options to transform traditional dairy system in \nEthiopia, Heliyon 9(11) based on analysis of FAOSTAT data\n\n31\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nAgri-finance in the context of smallholder production systems addresses the needs of \nfinancially excluded populations in rural communities. In particular, these include micro-, small- \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), women and youth. Therefore, there is a close relationship \nbetween agri-finance, which is a specialised form of finance that results in the funding of agricultural \nuse cases, and more general forms of rural finance. Agri-finance may therefore be considered a \nspecialised subset of rural finance, specifically targeted at on-farm activities, whereas rural finance \nis much broader and may support the non-farm and off-farm activities of a rural household. \nOver time, new categories of finance have emerged that closely intersect with agri-finance. \nThese include: \n• \nClimate finance, especially as it applies to the adoption of ‘climate smart agriculture’ \n(CSA) via new farm-level techniques and technologies that promote climate adaptation and \nresilience; \n• \nDigital financial services (DFS), which can synergise with the increasing digitalisation \nof agriculture itself, under the banner of ‘precision agriculture’, a term that refers to the \ngrowing utilisation of on-farm monitoring technologies backed by data analytics to improve \nthe efficiency of agricultural production; and\n• \nInterest free banking (IFB), which addresses the requirements of Islamic borrowers, and is \nan NFIS priority, and offers shariah-compliant product equivalents to conventional interest-\nbearing loan products that can fulfil each of the major agri-finance use cases.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n32\n\n33\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n3. \nMETHODOLOGY AND DATA\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n34\n3. METHODOLOGY AND DATA\n3.1 METHODOLOGY\nNAFIR has been developed using a mixed methods approach. \nQuantitative analysis has been performed on demand and supply-side data (see 3.2 below). \nData has been sourced from official sources and peer-reviewed research. The official data is highly \naggregated. FIs report data to the NBE on total agri-finance loan disbursement per financial year \nas well as loans outstanding at the end of the financial year. \nHowever, the demand-supply gap for agri-finance in Ethiopia is not merely quantitative, \nbut also cyclical, qualitative and distributional. Agri-finance must be tailored for different \ntypes of agricultural borrower31 across Ethiopia’s diverse agro-ecological zones and agricultural \nvalue chains to fulfil key agricultural ‘use cases’ at the right time of the season: crop inputs, \nirrigation, mechanisation, livestock, outputs and insurance. Fulfilment of these use cases drives \nproductivity gain, farm size expansion, post-harvest loss (PHL) reduction, diversification, livelihood \nstrengthening, gender and youth inclusion, climate adaptation and resilience. Agri-finance is also \nnecessary to enable efficient aggregation and supply of agricultural raw materials to downstream \nagro-industries, and to mitigate the high structural risks faced by the sector.\nTherefore, to supplement the official data with a deeper understanding of the cyclical, distributional \nand qualitative performance of agri-finance in Ethiopia, and to systematically engage stakeholders \non their perspectives and experiences, two rounds of stakeholder consultation took place during \nthe preparation of NAFIR, as well as a series of validation workshops to review the draft output:\n- \nDirect stakeholder engagement – a round of meetings and workshops held in November \n2024, and some additional meetings thereafter (see Annex II). \n- \nStakeholder survey – survey instruments were distributed in January 2025 by NBE to \nlicensed financial institutions and development partners; and through field survey interviews \nconducted across Ethiopia with a sample of agricultural producer cooperatives (APCs), rural \nsavings and credit cooperatives (RuSACCOs) and agro-processors (see Annex III). \n- \nValidation – workshops were held in April 2025 with financial institutions, public institutions \nand development partners, as well as bilateral meetings with key stakeholders (see Annex \nIV).\nTo shape understanding of the policy environment, the agriculture and socio-economic context, \nand the agri-finance stocktaking (see Chapters Four and Five below), a literature review has been \n31\t  Subsistence farmers; smallholder farmers; pastoralists; semi-commercial and commercial farmers.\nBox 4:\nAgri-Finance Demand/Supply Gaps\nQuantitative Gaps: is the supply of agri-finance sufficient to meet demand?\nCyclical Gaps: to what extent is agri-finance available when it is needed?\nDistributional Gaps: does the agri-finance reach those who need it – borrower types, use cases, value \nchains, regions and gender?\nQualitative Gaps: to what extent does the supply of agri-finance fulfil the needs of the beneficiary? \n\n35\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nperformed, incorporating policies, legislation, strategies, roadmaps, action plans, official reports, \nand peer-reviewed research, which has also been triangulated with outputs from the stakeholder \nengagement and survey. This review, coupled with stakeholder engagement, has generated a gap \nanalysis (see Chapter Six) from which the NAFIR recommendations have emerged.\nFinally, to provide inspiration for NAFIR, and in particular the transformative ‘game changing’ \nsolutions required to address unresolved challenges (see Chapter Seven), a literature review of \nAfrican and global agri-finance experience has been performed.\n3.2 DATA AND ANALYSIS\nA demand/supply analysis has been performed in the development of NAFIR to assess the demand \nand the supply of agri-finance in Ethiopia:\n• \nDemand-side analysis: quantification of which stakeholders need how much agri-finance \nfor which kind of use cases and value chains. \n• \nSupply-side analysis: quantification of which financial institutions are providing how much \nagri-finance for which kind of use cases and value chains.\nDamand-for-Finance \nFour demand-for-finance benchmarks have been identified:\nTable 2: Annual Demand for Finance Baseline Benchmarks 2023/24 \nMethod\nTYDP Policy\nTarget \nBy GDP \nAllocation\nBy Current \nFarmer Average \nLoan Size\nPotential Opportunity \nbased on Use Case \nQuantification by \nValue Chain\nTotal Potential \nDemand        \n(ETB billions)\n126\n154\n184\n2,582\nDemand \nfulfilment (%) \n– Including \nCBE Fertiliser \nFinance\n99%\n81%\n68%\n5%\nDemand \nfulfilment (%) \n– Excluding \nCBE Fertiliser \nFinance\n41%\n34%\n28%\n2%\nTYDP: The TYDP policy target for agri-finance in 2029/2030 is ETB 881 billion, rising from ETB 34.2 \nbillion in 2019/20 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.5%. The 2023/24 benchmark \nhas been calculated using this CAGR, providing a 2023/24 policy target of ETB 126 billion, as \nagainst actual supply of ETB 52 billion (ETB 125 billion with CBE fertiliser finance). This equates to \n99% of the target including CBE fertiliser finance, and 41% excluding CBE fertiliser finance. \nGDP Allocation: Per latest NBE statistics, agriculture contributes 32% to Ethiopian GDP. The \n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n36\nequivalent proportion of total bank, MFI and RuSACCO lending for financial year 2023/2024 is \nhere taken, providing a total of ETB 154 billion. Current agri-finance supply stands at 81% of the \ntarget including CBE fertiliser finance, and 34% excluding CBE fertiliser finance.\nFarmer Average Loan Size: Ethiopian Economics Association Policy Working Paper 08/22 \ncalculates agri-finance demand for 2021/22 based on the number of smallholder farmers multiplied \nby an average loan size per farmer (ETB 10,085) that has been derived from their own survey data. \nThe 2021/2022 indicator – ETB 122 billion - has been increased by the national inflation rate to \nprovide a 2023/24 value of ETB 184 billion. Current agri-finance supply stands at 68% of the target \nincluding CBE fertiliser finance, and 28% excluding CBE fertiliser finance.\nTotal Potential Demand Opportunity based on Use Case Quantification by Value Chain: In \nthe development of NAFIR, a granular quantification of potential annual demand-for-finance has \nbeen calculated by value chain according to each of the five main ‘use cases’ identified above. \nThis represents a scenario of fully modernised agriculture and comprises the key agri-finance \nuse cases across Ethiopia’s agricultural value chains in which producers access credit for crop \nand livestock inputs, irrigation, equipment and mechanisation services, and use output finance \nto support enhanced marketing. Current agri-finance supply stands at 5% of the total potential \ndemand including CBE fertiliser finance, and 2% excluding CBE fertiliser finance.\nThis latter method is likely to represent the truest measure of agri-finance total potential demand by \nEthiopian farmers based on the actual costs for which they need finance.\nFor crops, the average hectares planted per crop, sourced from FAOSTAT, has been multipled by the \ncost per hectare for each of the four crop-based agri-finance use cases – crop inputs, irrigation, \nmechanisation and outputs (amortised where applicable). Cost assumptions have been sourced \nfrom published peer-reviewed journals32. For livestock, the number of animals per category – \ncattle, sheep, goats, and poultry – as well as hives for apiculture has been multiplied by the annual \nmaterial costs of production (mainly feed and animal health) per animal/hive, and the amortised \nanimal stock replacement cost has been multiplied by animal/hive numbers according to estimated \naverage lifetime.\nTable 3: Potential Demand-for-Finance Opportunity Use Case Quantification Methodology\nUse Case\nMethodology\nCrop Inputs\nAnnual costs of seed, fertiliser and protection products per value chain, has been \nmultiplied by hectares planted per value chain based on 2020-2023 average area \nunder production data. \nIrrigation\nAnnual amortized cost of the irrigation kit and, where applicable, fuel, has been \naveraged across three technologies – solar pump, diesel pump and rope and washer \npump, assuming one pump serves two hectares.\nMechanisation\nCost of tractor hire per hectare has been used, assuming two uses per year: one \nfor land preparation pre-harvest, and one for harvest support and post-harvest \ntransportation.\n32\t Costs of production were obtained for 25 crop value chains, representing 86% of total area (hectares) under \nproduction per FAOSTAT, and then scaled up pro rata against average cost of production across the 25 value chains \nto account for the residual 14%.\n\n37\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nUse Case\nMethodology\nOutputs33\n2020-2023 average production data (metric tonnes) has been multiplied by current \naverage price data.\nAnimals \n(Annual)\nAnnual costs of animals per animal type for feed and animal health has been used, \nmultiplied by headcount. \nAnimals \n(Stock)\nAnnual amortised cost of animal purchase has been used, based on animal lifespan \nstatistics, multiplied by headcount. \nAll outputs have been standardised at 2024 values, adjusting for inflation using the historical \ninflation rate. It is assumed, for purposes of this demand quantification, that credit would cover \n70% of the total cost under each use case (e.g. if equipment cost is ETB 2,000/hectare, then credit \nwould cover 70% of this amount, or ETB 1,400/hectare). \nTo quantify the 2030 target, for crops, the long-term average trend in area under production growth \nhas been projected forward at a growth rate of 5.7% per annum, reflecting the 10-year average \naccording to World Bank Development Indicators. For livestock, historical animal headcount growth \nrates per animal type have been sourced from peer-reviewed research and projected forward. \nPrices have been held constant at 2023/24 levels.\nSupply-of Finance\nAgri-finance statistics in the country are reported by different categories of financial institution to \nthe NBE and the Ethiopian Cooperatives Commission (ECC).\nTable 4: Supply of Finance – Official Data\nFI Category\nReporting\nSource\nAgri-Finance \ndefinition\nBanks\n• Annual agri-finance loan disbursement.\n• Agri-finance loans outstanding at end of \nyear\nNBE\nUnclear\nMFIs\n• Agri-finance loans outstanding at end of \nyear\nNBE\nNBE \nDirective \nNo \nMFI/24/2013 \nwhich \ndefines \nagriculture \nas \n‘business \nthat \nincludes \ncultivating \nsoil, producing crops, \nraising livestock, bee-\nkeeping, fishery and \nother related activities’\n33\t At present time, producers receive minimal funds for aggregation finance. It is assumed that in a fully modernised \nagricultural system producers would store their produce and market it at a favourable time, likely using a warehouse \nreceipt system or an equivalent collateral custody arrangement to support aggregation financing, with loans \nsecured against the warehoused stock. This financing may be intermediated through cooperatives or other forms of \naggregator.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n38\nFI Category\nReporting\nSource\nAgri-Finance \ndefinition\nInsurance \n• Sum insured (ETB)\n• Premiums collected (ETB)\n• Claims (ETB)\nData has been provided separately for crop, \nlivestock and – in one case – floriculture \ninsurance, disaggregated by insurance \nprovider\nNBE\nUnclear\nCapital \nGoods \nFinancing \nCompanies\n• Outstanding balance (ETB)\nNBE\nUnclear\nRuSACCOs\n• Savings mobilisation (ETB)\n• Loan disbursement amount (ETB) \n• Repayment rate (%) \n• Number of borrowers (primary \ncooperatives only)\nData has been provided at aggregate level \nper year, separately for primary cooperatives \nand unions\nECC\nUnclear\nTwo definitional considerations merit attention:\n• \nFertiliser finance: Per the reported data, CBE is the largest supplier of agri-credit in Ethiopia, \nproviding in 2023/24 75% of total reported agri-finance, 17.9% of total bank credit across \nall sectors, and 16.6% of total credit across all sectors by all FI categories. Per CBE’s own \nestimates, approximately 90% of its agri-credit comprises the large-scale fertiliser financing \nthat the bank offers to support the availability and distribution of fertiliser in the country. In \nthis arrangement, the end user of the fertiliser – the farmer – must pay cash for the fertiliser, \nnot take it on credit34. Therefore, while recognising the critical importance of CBE fertiliser \nfinancing, statistics in the report are shown both including and excluding this amount (as stated \nin the text) according to context.\n• \nGrant finance: Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and development partners distribute significant \nagricultural goods and services to producers without charge. While recognising there are \ndifferent views, grant financing – or alternatively, free credit – is widely classified as a type of \nfinance. During consultations, several stakeholders have observed that – while there may be \nmerit to the practice of providing goods and services without charge to smallholder producers, \nbased on considerations of equity and affordability, especially when linked to national social \nprotection frameworks – it is important that these transfers are recorded within the scope of \nagri-finance reporting for two reasons. Firstly, it will enable grant funding to be leveraged in \n34\t It is understood that historically, the regional governments have extended credit to producers for funding the \npurchase of fertiliser, but that most of those schemes no longer function (see Abahey et al (2015), ‘Fertilizer Supply \nChain in Ethiopia: Structure, Performance and Policy Analysis’, Afrika Focus 28 (1).\n\n39\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nways that can be catalytic for increased private sector credit flows. Secondly, the effectiveness of \nsuch funding – both on its own terms, and relative to other funding approaches – will benefit \nfrom measurement and analysis. While grant funding has not been captured in the NAFIR agri-\nfinance data, the roadmap presented below proposes a pathway towards the future recordal and \nleveraging of grant financing for catalysing increased private sector credit flows.\nData has also been obtained from stakeholder surveys. Surveys have been distributed by NBE \nto all licensed FIs – banks, MFIs, capital goods financing firms, and insurance providers – and \nthrough field survey to a cross-representative sample of APCs, RuSACCOs and agro-processors \nthat covers the diverse regions, agro-ecological zones and value chains of the country. Each \nregion was allocated a specific number of survey targets based on the prominence and number \nof entities in that area, allowing for focused data collection. The surveys were conducted through \na combination of face-to-face interviews and telephone surveys. This dual approach allowed for \nflexibility in reaching participants, particularly in remote areas where face-to-face interaction was \nnot always viable.\n3.3  LIMITATIONS\nThe official data is highly aggregated, comprising reporting by FIs on total agri-finance loan \ndisbursement per annum and loans outstanding at year end. However, the potential agri-finance \ndemand/supply gaps may not only be quantitative but also cyclical, distributional and qualitative. \nTherefore, the stakeholder engagement and survey sought to understand – from both the demand-\nfor-finance and the supply-of-finance perspectives – these other dimensions of demand/supply \nperformance.\nFor the FI sector, not all FIs have responded to the surveys. Completed surveys responses have \nincluded qualitative and quantitative data. In some responses, there have been gaps, imprecisions \nor misunderstandings which NBE has followed up to resolve to the extent that has been possible \nwithin the study timeframe. However, a significant number of gaps remain due to existing FI systems \nnot systematically categorising agri-loans according to key parameters such as agri-borrower type, \nuse case, value chain, region and gender. Estimates have been sought where data has not been \navailable. The NAFIR framework presented below proposes a mechanism that will enable this data to \nbe more effectively defined, monitored and reported, and would be strengthened by application of \nconsistent definitions and tagging of loans by identified sub-segments.\nFor the APC, RuSACCO and agro-processor sectors, the survey execution faced significant \nchallenges that affected participation and data integrity. A critical limitation was the variability in \nrespondents’ willingness to engage, resulting in uneven response rates across regions. As with \nthe FIs, significant gaps emerged from respondents’ under-developed data management systems \nwhich hampered the accuracy and completeness of the information collected. The reluctance of \nsome representatives to participate or share data further complicated the survey efforts, resulting in \na lower response rate and potentially skewed data. Furthermore, reliance on face-to-face interviews \nintroduced logistical challenges, especially due to travel restrictions and the limited availability \nof respondents. Variability in literacy levels among participants affected their comprehension of \nsurvey questions, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the information provided. These factors \ncollectively highlighted the complexities of data collection in diverse regions, underscoring the \nneed for adaptable strategies to accommodate data- and information-gathering in varied contexts.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n40\n\n41\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n4. \nPOLICY CONTEXT\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n42\n4. POLICY CONTEXT\nNAFIR is a joint project of NBE and the MoA \nunder NFIS, the NBE Strategy 2023-26 and MoA \nTYAPP to enable the scale-up of agri-finance in \nEthiopia. NAFIR intersects with NFIS primarily as \na means to deepen financial inclusion, while also \ncontributing to the scaling of financial inclusion and \nthe advancement of financial education. It drives the \nfinancial deepening agenda primarily through NFIS \nProgram B2 (‘expanding access to credit’), while also \ncontributing to agri-sectoral efforts under Programs \nB3 (‘developing a strong micro-insurance system’) \nand B4 (‘drive Sharia-compliant financial products \nand services’). \nNAFIR contributes to NBE Strategy Strategic \nObjective 3: Ensure Financial Inclusion, Deepening \nand Digitisation, including the implementation and \nmonitoring of NFIS (3.1), enhancing financial\neducation and consumer protection (3.2), ensuring widespread adoption and usage of DFS (3.4), \nand improving credit reference and rating infrastructure (3.5). It also contributes to NBE Strategy \nStrategic Objective 4: Ensure Excellence in People, Processes and Technology, by re-establishing \nthe EIFS as a Center of Excellence for the financial sector (4.4).\nNAFIR contributes to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)’s Ten-Year Agricultural Sector \nPerspective Plan 2021-30 (TYAPP). TYAPP links closely with HGER and TYDP, while learning \nlessons from earlier development plans, including the first and second Growth and Transformation \nPlans.  \nKey lessons include: the need to shift \nfrom supply- to demand-based targeting \nto drive import substitution and export \ngrowth; a shift to high value products \nand market-oriented agriculture; and \nexpansion of irrigation.  In the TYAPP, \nagri-finance is one of ten thematic areas. \nPriority actions for agri-finance in TYAPP \ninclude institutional strengthening, loan \nportfolio development, increased use \nof movable asset collateral, alternative \nsources of finance, and enhancing \nagricultural insurance.  \nBox 5: \nNFIS-II Framework\nIntervention\nTypes\nFinancial\nService types\nPayments\nConsumer\nProtection,\nCapacity building,\nMarket structure\nScale\nBasic\nFinancial\nInclusion\nDeepen\nFinancial\nInclusion\nFinancial\nInfrastructure/\nAccess point\nInnovative\nProducts and\nServices\nSavings\nCredit\nInsurance\nBox 6: TYAPP Thematic Areas and Sectors\nLand\nTechnology & Input\nFinance\nIrrigation & Water Use\nOutput Marketing\nInfrastructure\nEnhanced Sector Contribution to BoP\nRural Entrepreneurship\nPrivate Sector Participation\nImplementation Capacity\nMarket-oriented Crop\nProduction and Productivity\nPillars in 10-Year\nSector Plan\nMinister’s 10 Thematic Areas\nMarket-oriented Livestock &\nFisheries Production and \nProductivity\nSustainable Natural Resource\nDevelopment and Utilization\n1\n2\n3\nSource: ATI\n\n43\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nNAFIR also contributes to other NBE \nstrategies. These include the National Financial \nEducation Strategy 2021-25 (NFES, Strategy \n2: Design and Implement Impactful National \nFinancial Education Programs, Modules and \nChannels) and the National Digital Payments \nStrategy 2021-24 \n(NDPS, Action 13: Digitise Payments in \nAgriculture).\nMore broadly, NAFIR supports overarching \nnational policy objectives. These include the \nHomegrown Economic Reform Agenda 2.0 \n(HGER) and the Ten-Year Development Plan \n2021-2030 (TYDP). \nThe main aim and focus of the HGER is the \n“enhancement of productivity and competitiveness \nof the overall economy, and a gradual transition \nfrom public to private sector-led growth” 35. \nIn this context, HGER agricultural sector reforms align closely with the agri-finance use cases \nidentified above, as well as HGER cross-cutting themes such as increased private sector participation, \nresearch, and import substitution:\nThe TYDP “has emphasised the proper identification of the linkages between various sectors of \nthe economy [and] recognizes the high interdependence and interconnectedness of the various \nproductive sectors, particularly, modern agriculture, manufacturing and mining through input-output \nlinkages.”. \nIn this context, the TYDP identifies key focus areas for agricultural development, which also align \nwith the agri-finance use cases identified above, including irrigation, mechanisation, and expansion \nof area under cultivation. These measures share a set of common objectives, which are to improve \nfarmer incomes and livelihoods, strengthen food security, enhance raw material supply to agro-\nindustries, grow exports, create jobs, and strengthen climate resilience. Gender equality is an \nimportant cross-cutting priority.\nIn this context, the TYDP sets a policy target for 2029/30 of loans to agriculture reaching ETB \n880.8 billion. This reflects growth from the baseline ETB 34.2 billion in 2019/20. Based on the \nCAGR this represents, it suggests a 2023/24 target of ETB 126 billion, as against actual supply of \nETB 52.0 billion per the latest NBE statistics for 2023/2436.\n35\t TYDP (page 9).\n36\t This excludes the CBE fertiliser financing, which has been traditionally counted as a component of agri-finance but \nis in fact a form of intermediated finance which does not result in financing to the farmer who must buy fertiliser for \ncash.\nBox 7: \nAims of HGER Agri-Sectoral Reform\nUse Case \nAlignment\nCross-Cutting \nMeasures\n•  Expand small- \nto large-scale \nirrigation \ndevelopment;\n•  Improve supply \nof inputs and \nfinance;\n•  Enhance \nlivestock \nproductivity;\n•  Reduce PHL;\n• Protect the \nenvironment and \nnatural resources \n• Improve agri-pro-\nduction methods\n• Improve the role \nand participation of \nprivate sector\n• Promote research-\nbased food security \nsystems \n• Promote import \nsubstituting agri-\ncrop production.\nSource: TYDP\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n44\nTable 5:  Allocation of Domestic Loans by Sector (ETB, billions)\nAverage\n2019/20\n2020/21 – 2024/25\n2025/26 – 2029/30\n2020/21 – 2020/30\n2029/30\nTotal Loan\n290.8\n591.0\n2214.2\n1328.8\n3262.1\nAgriculture\n34.2\n122.0\n553.86\n318.2\n880.8\nIndustry\n155.1\n289.3\n857.9\n547.8\n1295.1\nManufacturing\n27.2\n137.3\n683.36\n385.5\n1131.2\nFor service\n101.5\n179.7\n802.26\n462.8\n1086.2\nLoan supply by institutional beneficiary\nTotal Loan\n290.8\n591.02\n2214.2\n1402.61\n3262.1\nPrivate\n96.1\n115.22\n242.92\n179.07\n326.2\nGovernment\n194.7\n475.76\n1971.3\n1223.53\n2935.9\nSource: TYDP\nStrengthening agri-finance is identified as one of nine ‘Complementary Investment Projects’ \nunder Ethiopia’s National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) 2021-30. Drawing on HGER and \nTYDP, summarises national agri-finance priorities as follows:\n“Improving access to agricultural finance includes both the availability of agriculture-suitable \nproducts in the formal banking sector as well as formalizing and strengthening the rural \nsavings and credit cooperatives sector. \nInitial efforts will include formalizing the cooperatives sector, developing liquidity linkages \nwith commercial banks and microfinance institutions, and building a modern management \ncapability and financial control system to appropriately serve the rural population. \nFurther efforts to identify and create agricultural financial institutions including agricultural \nand cooperative banks should be explored. \nTailored efforts to promote agricultural finance products also include enhancing micro-\nlending and forward contracts through the building of institutional capacity of market actors. \nCollateralized commodity financing system (Warehouse Receipts System) is some of the areas \nto be promoted.” (p14)\nMeasures proposed by the NAIP including policy review, strengthening rural financial institutions, \nincreasing use of movable property collateral, and – over the medium-to-long term – establishing \nan ‘Agricultural Bank of Ethiopia’. More broadly, echoing HGER, the NAIP emphasises the need for \nincreased private sector participation, in part to bridge the financing gap in agriculture that was \nnoted above. Another way to bridge the agri-financing gap is to improve the linkages between \ncooperatives and rural financial institutions on the one hand and the commercial banking sector \non the other.  \nBy fulfilling HGER, TYDP, NAIP and TYAPP objectives, NAFIR maps to the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), and the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063.\n\n45\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nTable 6: Mapping Policy Objectives to the SDGs\nKey SDG \nContributions:\n              \n                                          \nAdditional SDG \nContributions:\n             \n             \n            \n \nKey Agenda \n2063 \nContributions\nGoal 4: Transformed economies\nGoal 5: Modern Agriculture for Increased Productivity and Production\nAdditional \nAgenda 2063 \nConttributions\nGoal 1:   A high standard of living, quality of life and well-being for all citizens.\nGoal 7: Environmentally-sustainable climate-resilient economies & communities\nGoal 17: Full gender equality in all spheres of life\nGoal 20: Africa takes full responsibility for financing her development goals\nIn addition, NAFIR contributes to a wide range of additional agricultural- and agri-finance-\nrelated strategies, roadmaps and action plans that have been developed in recent years. \nThese are documented below in Table 7 under Chapter Five.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n46\n\n47\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n5. \nAGRI-FINANCE \nSTOCK-TAKING\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n48\n5.

Since they \nconverted to become banks, the converted MFIs have accounted for a large and increasing share \nof agri-finance in the country, rising from 33% in 2021/22 to 43% in 2023/24. Conversely, the \nshares of RuSACCOs and MFIs have been falling steadily – RuSACCOs from 58% in 2019/20 to \n25% in 2023/24 and MFIs from 18% in 2019/20 to 8% in 2020/23. The public bank contribution, \nexcluding fertiliser finance, has held relatively steady at current levels while the pre-2021 private \nbanks saw some level of volatility in their contribution – from 6% in 2019/20, up to 18% in 2020/21, \nand then gradually falling back to its current level of just 5%.\nCharts 10-11: \nProportion of Overall Bank Credit        \n \n     Proportion of FI Credit Supplied to  \n  \nSupplied to Agriculture 2019/20-2023/24 (%) \n     Agriculture 2019/20-2023/24 (%)\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2%\nIncluding CBE Fertilizer Finance\n13%\n11%\n6%\n15%\n24%\n2%\n4%\n10%\n8%\n2019/20\n2020/21\n2021/22\n2022/23\n2023/24\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2019/20\n2020/21\n2021/22\n2022/23\n2023/24\nExcluding CBE Fertilizer Finance\nPublic Banks\nPre 2021 Private Banks\nPost 2021 Private Banks\nMFIs\n \nSource: NBE\nNote: excludes CBE fertiliser finance; RuSACCO lending is not reported separately for agri- and non-agri lending. As above, \nthe RuSACCO sector offers finance to rural borrowers, it has been counted towards agri-finance in totality. \nThe proportion of total credit supplied to agriculture varies significantly in amount and trend \nacross different FI types. The overall proportion of bank credit reaching agriculture, as reflected in \nofficial NBE reporting data, stood at 24% in 2023/24 – an impressive performance which shows \na steeply upward growth curve. However, these numbers mask a number of underlying trends that \nbecome visible when the data is broken out by FI type. Firstly, most of the growth has been driven \nby public sector financing, the large majority of which comprised the CBE fertiliser finance. When \nthe CBE fertiliser finance is excluded, the proportion of bank credit that reaches the farmer stood \nat approximately 8% in 2023/24. \nOverall, this represents a rising trend from 2019/20. Despite this, when the data is broken out by FI \ntype, it shows that, aside from the public banks, all sectors are showing a decline in the proportion \nof credit that is supplied to agriculture. There has been a long-term decline in the proportion of \ncredit supply to agriculture from the MFI sector, and a sharp fall from the new banks and converted \nMFIs. For the pre-2021 private banks, the proportion of credit supplied to agriculture remains \nrange-bound at minimal levels (1-3% of total lending) with a fall during 2023/24.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n50\nTable 7: Agri-Finance Performance during the 2023-24 Credit Contraction\n2023-24 Credit \nCorrection\nTotal Banks\nPublic Banks\nPre-2021 \nPrivate Banks\nPost-2021 \nPrivate Banks\nMFIs*\nRuSACCOs\nALL\n-14%\n+59%\n-43%\n-24%\n+26%\nAGRI-FIN\n+41%\n+97%\n-69%\n-13%\n+5%\n-55%\nDuring 2023/24, there was a 14% credit contraction in overall bank finance. Despite this, on \naverage, agri-finance significantly expanded. However, this expansion was mainly driven by the \npublic banks which were unaffected by the credit contraction. \nThe private banks saw agri-finance fall. In the case of the converted MFIs, this fall was proportional \nto the overall credit contraction. However for the pre-2021 private banks, lending to agriculture fell \nmore than proportionally compared with total lending. RuSACCOs also experienced a significant \ncontraction, with lending falling by 55%. MFI lending increased during the period, but agri-loans \ngrew significantly less rapidly than overall lending.\nInsurance has shown significant overall growth since 2021/22, with particular growth in \nlivestock and floriculture insurance from four providers (Africa, EIC, Nyala, Oromia). However, \ndespite a significant increase in crop insurance from 2022/23 to 2023/24, the total value stands at \na level not much higher than in 2016/17. \nCharts 12-13: \nInsurance by Type \n \n       \n \n         Capital Goods Agri-Finance \n(Sum Insured, ETB m)   \n \n \n         Oustanding Balance (ETB m)\n5,000\n6,000\n4,000\n3,000\n2,000\n1,000\nCrop Insurance\n2016/17\n2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24\nLivestock Insurance\nFloriculture Insurance\n-\n500\n600\n400\n300\n200\n100\n2019/20\n2020/21\n2021/22\n2022/23\n2023/24\n-\n \nSource: NBE\nAn extensive range of initiatives to promote agro-insurance have been established through \npartnerships between government and development partners. The United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), with the MoA, launched the Insurance and Risk Finance Facility (IRFF) in 2024, \nwhile ATI has partnered with World Food Programme (WFP), the African ’insurtech’ firm, Pula, and \nthe German development agency, KfW, to promote disaster-risk insurance in key drought-affected \nareas linked to the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) framework. \nFinancial Sector Deepening (FSD) Ethiopia has provided support for agro-insurance through the \n\n51\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nlaunch of an insurtech accelerator platform, BimaLab. Programmatic frameworks have focused \non strengthening insurance, including the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-\nsponsored Index-based Crop Insurance Promotion Project for Rural Resilience Enhancement (ICIP), \nwhich held four stakeholder Dialogue Platform Meetings between May 2022 and January 2024, \nand the IFAD-led Platform for Agricultural Risk Management (PARM).\nCapital goods financing, based on legislation introduced in 1998 and amended in 2013, has \nalso been growing but suffered reverses between 2021/22 and 2023/24. Six capital goods \nfinancing businesses have been licensed by the NBE, of which one has since exited. The sector \nprovides leasing solutions that fund the procurement of equipment, including agricultural assets \nsuch as tractors, combines, irrigation systems and other farm equipment. \n5.2 AGRI-FINANCE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS\nLooking at the agri-finance landscape more broadly, significant investments have been made in \nrecent years by GoE, private sector and development partners (see Table 8 below). \nRegulations and cross-cutting financial and digital infrastructure have been introduced. These \ninclude the CRB, the national identity (National ID) scheme, and frameworks for capital goods \nfinancing, contract farming and integrated agro-industrial parks (IAIPs). \nRegistries have been developed by NBE, the MoA and MoTRI so that agricultural assets can \nserve as loan collateral to fulfil key agri-finance use cases. These include:  \n•\t\nSecondary level land use certificates (SLLCs) under the National Rural Land Administration \nInformation System (NRLAIS) operated by the MoA;\n•\t\nWarehouse receipts (WR) under the National Warehouse Receipt System (NWRS), operated \nby MoTRI, and under the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX);\n•\t\nLivestock in the Ethiopian Livestock Identification and Traceability System (EthLITS), operated \nby MoA, which is in the process of being enhanced; and \n•\t\nMovable assets under the Movable Property Security Registry (MPSR) operated by NBE.\nThese registries enable agricultural assets to be uniquely identified, registered and pledged \nas collateral security against credit. This new financial infrastructure has been underpinned \nby legislation, strategies and programmes, and backed by capacity-building efforts focused \non both the demand- and supply sides, with support from development partners such as the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC). \n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n52\nTable 8: Agri-Finance Landscape by Use Case\nInputs\nIrrigation\nMechanisation\nOutputs\nLivestock\nRegistries\nNRLAIS\nMPSR\nNRLAIS\nMPSR\nNRLAIS\nMPSR\nWRS (NWRS/ECX)\nMPSR\nEtLlTS\nMPSR\nLaws\nRural Land \nAdministration \nand Use \nProclamation \n2024\nAgricultural \nContract\nProduction \nProclamation \n2023\nMPSR \nProclamation \n2019 /\nDirective 2020\nRural Land \nAdministration \nand Use \nProclamation \n2024\nCapital Goods \nLeasing Business \n(Amendment) \nProclamation \n2013\nAgricultural \nContract \nProduction \nProclamation \n2023\nMPSR \nProclamation \n2019 / Directive \n2020\nRural Land \nAdministration and \nUse Proclamation \n2024\nCapital Goods \nLeasing Business \n(Amendment) \nProclamation 2013\nAgricultural \nContract \nProduction \nProclamation 2023\nMPSR Proclamation \n2019 / Directive \n2020\nWRS Proclamation \n2003 / \nimplementing \ndirective 2020\nSpecial \nEconomic Zone \nProclamation \n2024\nAgricultural \nContract \nProduction \nProclamation \n2023\nMPSR \nProclamation \n2019 / Directive \n2020\nLive Animals \nMarketing \nProclamation \n2013\nAgricultural \nContract \nProduction \nProclamation \n2023\nMPSR \nProclamation \n2019 / Directive \n2020\nStrategies,\nRoadmaps\nAgricultural \nExtension\nStrategy 2017\nEthiopia Seed \nSector\nStrategy and \nInvestment\nPlan (AGRA) \n2022\nNational \nSmallholder \nIrrigation and \nDrainage\nStrategy 2016\nEthiopia Climate \nSmart\nAgriculture \nRoadmap\n2020-30 / \nInvestment Plan\n/ 2024\nEthiopian National\nAgricultural \nMechanization \nStrategy 2014\nPostharvest \nManagement\nStrategy of Ethiopia \n2024\nGrain Postharvest \nManagement \nStrategy 2018\nNational Storage \nStrategy\n(ATI) 2017\nEthiopia Industrial\nDevelopment \nStrategy\n2013-25 / \nRoadmap 2014\nLivestock \nInformation\nSystem Roadmap \n2021\nLivestock Master \nPlan 2015-20\nLivestock and \nFisheries\nExtension \nStrategy and\nRoadmap 2023-\n33\nInitiatives \nand\nProgrammes\nAgricultural \nCommercialisation \nClusters/One Stop \nShops (ATI)\nInput Voucher \nSystem (ATI)\nEthiopia Soil \nInformation System \n(EthioSIS)\nParticipatory \nSmall-Scale \nIrrigation \nDevelopment \nProgramme II \n(IFAD)\nEthiopia Soil \nInformation \nSystem (EthioSIS)\nKfW/DBE Agri\nMechanization \nProject\nNational Market\nInformation \nSystem (NMIS)\n(ATI)\nLivestock & \nFisheries Sector \nDevelopment \nProject\nFood Security \nImprovement \nProject for \nPastoralists \n(BREFONS, \nDRIVE)\n\n53\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nCross-\nCutting \nEnablers\nMoA TYAPP 2021-2030 / Revised Agriculture and Rural Development Policy 2024\nEthiopian Agricultural Authority\nAgro/Livestock Insurance – Insurance and Risk Finance Facility (MoA/UNDP), ARC (ATI/\nWFP), PARM (IFAD), ICIP (JICA)\nCredit Reference Bureau (CRB)\nNational ID (‘Fayda’)\nInterest Free Banking – banks, RuSACCOs\nDFS Strategies (e.g. Digital Ethiopia 2025, Digital Agri Roadmap 2032 (MoA), National \nDigital Payments Strategy (NBE) 2021-24, ATI Digital Agri..)\nDFS Platforms - AgTech (Lersha, Kifiya), Mobile Money (TeleBirr, MPESA), MCF FarmPass \nCooperatives – ECC Strategy; Agricultural Cooperative Development Strategy (ATI) 2015\nNational Financial Education Strategy (NFES)\nRuSACCO Capacity Building Project (ATI)\nNational Programmes (e.g. RUFIP III (IFAD, EIB, EU, AGRA), Integrated Agricultural \nDevelopment Project (WBG)\nValue Chain Strategies (e.g. Coffee 2019-33, Horticulture 2025-2034, Pulses 2016-20, \nApiculture 2013)\nValue Chain Specific Programmes (e.g. Horticulture - Ethio-SHEP 2, Wheat – CREW) \nThe value of loans disbursed against agricultural assets pledged in the new registries has \ngrown rapidly and reached significant levels.

This growth has been \nassisted by the regulatory requirement for FIs to disburse 5% of loans per annum against movable \ncollateral39. MPSR 2023/24 data shows that total movable asset registrations stood at 221,367 \nassets40. Of these, 1,563 – less than 1% –  were agricultural assets. Of these agricultural assets, a \nmajority – 1,311 of the 1,563 – were machinery, followed by WRs (131), consignments of produce \n(103), and SLLCs (11). Livestock has not yet been registered to date.\nThe MoA has established a Rural Finance Unit and is working to develop an ‘Agri-Stack’ \nunder the Digital Agriculture Roadmap 2032. These initiatives will leverage the registries and \ndigitisation initiatives the MoA has established to support the further development of the agri-\nfinance landscape and link the agri-finance scale-up efforts to the real sector enablers, including \nland and livestock registries, extension services, and input distribution systems.\nSignificant efforts have been made by the Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI) to build \nfoundations for access to agri-finance and rural financial inclusion (see Box 8 below). \n \n39 Directive No MCR/01/2020, article 19.1\n40 Of these, 143,072 (65%) were non-agricultural vehicles, and 57,786 (26%) were non-agricultural machinery.\nBox 8: \nATI Initiatives\nACCs:  clearly defined geographic clusters specialising in priority commodities across the four \nmajor agricultural regions of the country. They act as hubs through which regions are supported \nto maximise production and productivity while integrating commercialisation activities. Currently, \nthere are over 101,000 ACCs comprising nearly 4.5 million farmers that cultivate 3.5 million \nhectares with twelve focal crops (seven grains and oilseeds, five horticulture products). \nAOSS: input centres and retail shops that provide access for smallholder farmers to agricultural \ninputs and advisory services across the four agricultural regions. Over 330 AOSS have been \nestablished with total transaction value of ETB 11.7 billion.\nIVS: vouchers issued by FIs, including RuSACCOs and MFIs, to smallholder farmers to be \nredeemed for fertiliser and improved seed at a primary cooperative store. The IVS enables FIs\n\n55\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nThese initiatives include the development of agricultural commercialisation clusters (ACCs), \nagriculture one-stop shops (AOSS), the input e-voucher system (IVS), the 8028 farmer hotline, and \nthe national market information system (NMIS). ATI has also provided extensive capacity-building \nsupport in partnership with the Ethiopian Cooperatives Commission (ECC) to RuSACCOs under an \ninstitutional strengthening framework.\nAgri-finance could potentially benefit from the surge in DFS that Ethiopia has experienced \nsince 2020., if expanded into rural areas in the next phases. Digital access points in the country \nhave multiplied nearly seven times in just three years, rising from 38,700 in mid-2020 to 253,000 by \nmid-2023.

After initially rolling \nout as a manual system, ATI joined up with Kifiya in 2024 to digitalise the IVS as an e-voucher \nplatform to promote efficiency and scalability. In 2023, over 6.6 million producers participated \n(20% female), purchasing over 11.5 million quintals of seed and fertiliser, in cash or on credit, \nwith total value of ETB 31.7 billion.\nNMIS: provides timely, accurate, and relevant market information to stakeholders, based on \nweekly market data polled from by woreda-level government enumerators, subject to a scientific \npolling methodology and the application of advanced analytical techniques for price forecasting \nand trend analysis. The NMIS is available through website, by email for registered subscribers, \nand via toll-free interactive voice response (IVR)-based hotline. Currently, the NMIS covers 19 \ncrops and 311 marketplaces. The hotline has registered over 1.6 million users, and there have \nbeen 8.8 million visits to the NMIS website to access market data. \n8028 Farmer Hotline:  a toll-free service that disseminates advisory information to farmers on \nagronomic best practices, financial literacy, and other relevant information. It works via SMS and \nIVR, which is critical given the low literacy rates and smart phone penetration in many rural parts \nof Ethiopia. The hotline has four components – an automated call service which farmers can \ncall to obtain advice; broadcast SMS and IVR ‘push’ content, to send out customised messaging \nto farmers; an IVR-based expert help desk; and an interactive survey to collect data from users.\nRuSACCO support: An institutional strengthening framework delivered by ATI together with \nECC and Regional Cooperative Producer Agencies. ATI has performed capacity assessments \nand gap analyses on nearly 4,000 RuSACCOs using a diagnostic tool, leading to structured \ninterventions comprising staff training, improved policies and manuals, strengthened information \nsystems, and support for improved agricultural product design.\nSource: ATI\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n56\nChart 15: Digital Access Point and Accounts  \n  Chart 16: Cash versus Digital Transaction \nVolume 2019-23  \n \n \n \n \n  (ETB b), 2019-23\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n0\nDigital Access Points\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2023\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nDigital Accounts\nDigital \nCash\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n \nSource: NBE\nMobile money agents have increased over ten times in the same period.

Of these, over 70 million mobile money accounts have been \ncreated through Ethio Telecom’s TeleBirr service and Safaricom’s M-PESA. It is understood that \nmuch of the DFS growth to date has taken place in urban areas. \nThe emergence of agfintech platforms such as Lersha and Kifiya, and digital platforms such as \nMastercard Farm Pass have made an impact in the agri space specifically. Agfintech platforms \ncombine field-based agents, highly functional technology platforms and big data analysis, which \nenable FIs to overcome the physical barriers to financing agriculture.  Farm Pass, introduced by \nMastercard in partnership with the Cooperative Bank of Oromia, enables farmers and cooperatives \nto digitally connect to the agriculture marketplace, streamlining transactions and financial services, \nand enhances access to inputs, services and credits. More than 510,000 farmers, primary \ncooperatives and cooperative unions have been onboarded, generating more than ETB 440million \nin transactions in key value chains such as coffee, wheat, barley, and dairy.\nAgri-finance has featured within numerous programmes and pilots. The key national programme \nspecifically focused on agri-finance is the Rural Financial Intermediation Programme (RUFIP) , \nfunded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) together with the European \nInvestment Bank, European Union and AGRA (see Box 9 below).\nBox 9: RUFIP-III\nRUFIP is now in its third iteration having been originally launched in 2001. \nRUFIP-III is a USD 300 million project, which launched in 2020.

Additional value chain specific programmes are in place, including the AfDB-\nfunded Climate Resilient Wheat Value Chain Development Project, the Japan-funded Project for \nSmallholder Horticulture Farmer Empowerment through Promotion of Market-Oriented Agriculture, \nand the World Bank-funded Livestock and Fisheries Sector Development Project.\nNAFIR survey responses, comprising 23 banks and 22 MFIs, identified eleven agri-finance pilots \nthat took place between 2010-2024 – six by banks and five by MFIs.\n \nThese pilots have covered a range of themes:\n- \nGender: Introducing new lending and distribution techniques for reaching women farmers;\n- \nProducts: introducing new products such as VCF and other types of farmer production loan, \nbacked by risk-sharing facilities;\n- \nTechnologies: introducing new technologies for digital distribution of agri-finance and \nmicroloans; and\n- \nLinkages:  introducing new on-lending arrangements between banks and MFI/RuSACCOs.\nChart 17: Number of Agri-Finance Pilots and Scale-Up\nMFIs\nScale Up\nNo Scale Up\nBanks\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nSource: NAFIR Survey 2025\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n58\n\n59\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n6. \nGAPS AND \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n60\n6. GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nAs shown in the previous chapter, significant investment has been made by government, \ndevelopment partners and private sector to build Ethiopia’s emergent agri-finance landscape. \nIn this context, a key question explored during the development of NAFIR is the following: \nWill the maturation of agri-finance initiatives already underway be sufficient to drive the scale-\nup of agri-finance to the necessary levels, or are there additional measures also required?\nChart 18: Key Constraints to Scaling-Up Agri Finance – the FIs’ Perspective\n(5 = High Constraints; 1 = No Constraints)\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n-\n4.4\n4.2\n3.9\n3.9\n3.7\n3.6\n3.5\n3.4\n3.4\n3.3\n3.1\n3.1\n3.1\nFund\nAvailability\nCollateral\nLimitation\nFinancial\nLiteracy\nCredit\nRisk\nClimate\nRisk\nDistribution/\nChannel\nPrice and Market\nRisk\nOther Production\nRisk\nTechnology\nPolicy\nRegulation\nProduct \ndesign\nInstitutional \nCapacity\nAll Fis\nBanks\nMFIs\nSource: NAFIR Survey 2025\nNote: the chart shows the; average scores across 45 respondents (23 banks, 22 MFIs); FI respondents were asked “What \nare the key bottlenecks to scaling up agri-finance in Ethiopia today? Please rate each one on a scale from 1 (not a bottleneck \nat all) to 5 (a major bottleneck), and add comments to explain your response.”\nThe findings suggest that even when all these investments come to maturity, key structural \nand coordination constraints are still likely to hold back the scale-up of agri-finance to meet \npolicy ambitions. \n• \nStructural constraints represent missing parts of the agri-finance landscape and include: \no \nQuantitative and cyclical limitations to loanable funds availability for FI agri-lending, reflective \nof economy-wide credit constraints in which demand for finance far outstrips supply;\no \nSpecific disincentives for financing agriculture compared with other sectors driven by the \nhigh costs and risks of financing farmers; and \no \nCompliance bottlenecks as producers struggle to meet regulatory and documentary \nrequirements, driving weeks if not months of time-consuming and resource-intensive effort \nby both producer and FI to approve and disburse a loan. \n• \nCoordination constraints do not represent an absence of activity but rather inadequate \ncoordination to drive sustainable, nationally scalable impact, and have been identified in the \n\n61\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nfollowing areas: \no \nBuilding the financial literacy of agri-borrowers;\no \nDeveloping agricultural risk management frameworks; and \no \nFacilitating integration and institutional linkages among agri-finance actors41. \nSTRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT 1 – LOANABLE FUND AVAILABILITY: \nDemand today for agri-finance far exceeds supply. Systemic \nconstraints in the availability of loanable funds – cyclical as well as \nquantitative – are likely to prevent a natural scale-up of the agri-\nfinance supply to fulfil this demand even as the range of agri-finance \nlandscape initiatives reach maturity. The current round of national \nreforms – in particular, the opening of the banking sector – is likely \nto make available additional resources, some of which may flow to \nagriculture. However, this is unlikely to fill all, or even most of the \nagri-finance resource gap. We can anticipate this because, even \nthough most African banking jurisdictions have long been open, the \nunder-financing of agriculture remains a continent-wide challenge. \nRECOMMENDATION 1: To fill the agri-finance resource gap, there \nis need for a mechanism that can mobilise additional resources \nand ensure these funds flow specifically to agriculture. \nSTRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT 2 - DISINCENTIVES: \nCosts and risks of financing agriculture are higher than in other \nsectors. FI shareholder and depositor interests are served by \nallocating finance to sectors that offer the highest returns. The agri-\nfinance initiatives already underway will help reduce the cost and \nrisk of financing agriculture. However, it will take many years for \nthese costs and risks to fully equalise with other sectors42.  We may \nconclude from this that the market for finance, left to function by itself, \nwill not fulfil the needs of agriculture for the foreseeable future due \nto the sector’s continuing high cost and risk profile. The proportion \nof private sector bank credit to agriculture remains persistently low \nwhile the banks that converted from MFIs, and the MFIs themselves, \nare significantly reducing the proportion of credit supplied to the \nsector. The NBE’s 2020 Directive requiring 5% of bank lending to \ntake place against movable assets – a directive issued with the intent \nto help scale funding to agriculture and MSMEs – has not seen a \nsignificant supply of credit flow to agriculture, with agricultural assets \nhaving a share of less than 1% of total assets registered in the MPSR \nin the last financial year.  \nRECOMMENDATION 2: There is need for a comprehensive \nframework of incentives to stimulate more lending by FIs to \nagriculture that reduce the costs and risks of financing the sector. \n41\t  Including between commercial banks and rural FIs, between domestic and foreign institutions in the context of the \nopening of the banking sector, and between FIs and new and emerging digital platforms which hold the promise to \novercome key barriers to financial inclusion in the agricultural sector.\n42\t Among other factors, agri-loans for the foreseeable future will remain small-scale and fragmented; there is a long-\nterm horizon for scaling risk mitigation instruments, developing distribution, diffusing technology, and building \nfinancial literacy.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n62\nSTRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT 3 - COMPLIANCE: We understand \nfrom various agri-finance pilots in Ethiopia that trying to finance \nsmallholder farmers is costly, time-consuming and difficult (see Box 1 \nin Chapter One above).  Pilots have ended up financing many fewer \nfarmers than targeted. In the past, temporary exemptions and waivers \nhave been requested from NBE so that pilots can take place. Obtaining \ndocuments to comply with regulations has been a particular challenge. \nThe National ID scheme can help to address part of this documentary \nchallenge by streamlining the ‘know your client’ (KYC) requirements to \nonboard new agri-borrowers.  However, the documentary requirements \nto support credit appraisal will still generate many challenges for both \nborrower and lender to fulfil. \nRECOMMENDATION 3: There is a need to streamline compliance to \nreduce the costs of finance and provide timely credit to Ethiopia’s \nfarmers as a way to scale up agri-finance in the country.\nThe remaining three constraints – financial literacy, agricultural risk \nmanagement, and institutional linkages – are areas where important \nefforts have been made to date, reflecting significant investment by \ngovernment, development partners and private sector. Yet these have \nbeen too often characterised as fragmented, small-scale and program-\nspecific which has precluded decisive progress. There is a need in \neach area for strategic and coherent frameworks that are systematic, \ncoordinated and have long-term continuity. \nCOORDINATION CONSTRAINT 4 - LITERACY: Ethiopia’s farmers \ncontinue to struggle with financial literacy, as well as the digital literacy \nnecessary to adopt DFS. It is understood that literacy programmes \nto date have been small-scale and program-specific rather than \nsystematic. \nRECOMMENDATION 4: There is a need for an effort to systematically \nbuild financial and related digital literacy at scale in the agricultural \nsector. \nCOORDINATION CONSTRAINT 5 – AGRICULTURAL RISK \nMANAGEMENT: The availability of suitable insurance products to \nmitigate key risks faced by producers is an important enabler of \nbankability to drive the scaling up of agri-loans. Crop and livestock \ninsurance products remain a relatively small niche within the business \nof those insurance firms that offer them. Stakeholders – including the \ninsurers themselves – have noted the scaling up of these products \nface major system-level constraints which require a sustained effort to \naddress:\n•\t\nHigh insurance premiums can be prohibitive for producers to take up \ncrop and livestock insurance. These are driven by low levels of overall \nuptake, high distribution costs, and limitations in the diversification of \nthe underlying risks;\n\n63\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n•\t\nHigh levels of sensitisation and capacity-building are required by \nproducers and cooperatives to understand the product and know why \nit is valuable. Factors such as geographic distance, infrastructure gaps \nand low field presence make this expensive and time-consuming to \ndeliver. \nIn addition, it is noted that a solution has not yet been identified to \nmitigate the risks of price volatility which FIs cite as an important \nimpediment to agri-finance (see Chart 18 above).\nRECOMMENDATION 5: A national agricultural risk management \nframework is required to tackle the system-wide barriers to scaling-\nup crop and livestock insurance, and to introduce price risk \nmanagement instruments.\nCOORDINATION CONSTRAINT 6 – INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGES: \nSignificant efforts have been made, by ATI and under RUFIP, among \nothers, to build institutional linkages between banks on the one hand \nand MFIs and RuSACCOs on the other. These linkages enable banks \nto partner with rural FIs which own the customer relationships, have \ndeep contextual knowledge of the rural client base, and operate \ndistribution channels that bridge the rural ‘last mile’. This can result in \nmore efficient, inclusive and resilient distribution of financial products \nand services. New kinds of ‘last mile’ partnerships are also being \nestablished between FIs and emergent agfintech platforms such as \nLersha and Kifiya. Furthermore, the opening up of the banking sector \nmay bring partnership opportunities with foreign FIs which can help \naddress the loanable funds and capacity constraints faced by the \ndomestic institutions.\nRECOMMENDATION 6: A national framework is required to \nsystematise the facilitation of robust and scalable linkages among \nFIs, as well as digital platforms, especially in the context of the \nopening up of the banking sector to foreign institutions.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n64\n\n65\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n7. \nNAFIR GAME-CHANGERS \nAND VISION\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n66\n7. NAFIR GAME-CHANGERS AND VISION\n ‘Game-changers’ under NAFIR are positioned \nas transformative solutions to the remaining \nconstraints that can integrate and energise \nEthiopia’s agri-finance landscape to catalyse \nand enable the necessary scale-up. In the \ndevelopment of NAFIR, a review of African and \ninternational experiences has been conducted to \nidentify potential solutions for Ethiopia which may \nbe effective in addressing those constraints. \nThree game-changing opportunities have \nbeen identified as the pillars of NAFIR for \nshort-term impact that will resolve the \nremaining constraints to agri-finance scale-\nup within a dynamic, specialised, digitalised \nand data-driven agri-finance landscape: \n•\t National Agri-Finance Accelerator (NAFA): a \nrefinancing and risk-sharing vehicle, based on \nexperiences from Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, \nTogo and India among others43, that makes \navailable loanable funds earmarked specifically \nfor agriculture and and reduces the risk of \nlending to the agricultural sector. \n• Farmer Access to Streamlined Financial \nServices (FAST): an efficient interface for \nFIs to access farmer information, and for the \nfarmer to access credit, based on experiences \nfrom Côte d’Ivoire, India and Pakistan. FAST \nstreamlines compliance and reduces the \ncost of financing agriculture, while integrating \nand creating traceability along the value chain; \nand \n•\t Agri-Finance Centre of Excellence (CoE): a \nhub \nfor \nintegrating \nfinancial \nliteracy, \ninstitutional linkages and agricultural risk \nmanagement efficiently and cost-effectively \ninto NAFIR implementation through strategic \nand coherent long-term frameworks, while \nbuilding FI and regulatory capacity to adopt \nagri-finance best practices and enhance \nreadiness to take on credit lines that drive \nfurther scale-up of FI loanable fund access.\n•\t\n43  See Szebini et al 2021. ‘A technical review of select African de-risking schemes’. Rome, FAO, AGRA and IFAD.\nBox 10: \nUganda Agricultural Credit Facility (ACF)\nLaunched in 2009 by the Bank of Uganda, \nthe ACF is a refinancing facility through which \ngovernment shares in 50% of qualifying \nagri-loans provided by banks and 70% by \nMFIs. The loans are subject to minimum \nand maximum amounts, and a cap on the \ninterest rate and FI processing fees. Activities \neligible for ACF refinancing include irrigation, \ninputs, machinery, outputs, animal stock, land \nopening, storage and value addition.\nBox 11: \nCôte d’Ivoire Cocoa/Coffee Farmer Card\nCôte d’Ivoire – the world’s largest cocoa \nproducer – has developed and rolled out \nsince early 2024 an electronic card for \nover 900,000 of the country’s one million \ncocoa and coffee farmers. The card is \nintegrated with electronic payment and digital \nwallet functionality. It is used during sales \ntransactions to record and trace the sale of \ngoods from farmgate, ensure farmers receive \na price at or above the set minimum prices, \nfacilitate digital payments by buyers, enable \nfarmers to make savings and avoid the risks of \nkeeping cash at home, and for use by farmers \nto buy farm goods. \nBox 12: \nIndia’s Kisan (Farmer) Credit Card\n“The Kisan Credit Card scheme aims at \nproviding adequate and timely credit support \nfrom the banking system under a single \nwindow with flexible and simplified procedure \nfor the farmers. it meets the short-term credit \nrequirements for: cultivation of crops; post-\nharvest expenses; produce marketing loans; \nconsumption requirements of the farmer’s \nhousehold; working capital for maintenance of \nfarm assets and activities allied to agriculture; \nand \ninvestment \ncredit \nrequirement \nfor \nagriculture and allied activities.”\nSource: Reserve Bank of India Circular 2017\n\n67\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nThis approach makes sure not only that mobilised resources are specifically earmarked for \nagriculture, but also that credit reaches where it is needed most – agri-borrower types, use cases, \nvalue chains, regions, gender, insurance – to make sure that no-one gets left behind.\nNAFIR innovates by integrating the implementation of these game changers. It leap-frogs \nhistorical experiences in other countries by capitalising on innovations which are just coming to \nscale in Ethiopia, in particular Digital Financial Services (DFS), based on a wide range of advances \nincluding National ID, MoA digitisation initiatives, electronic agricultural asset registries, the ATI IVS \nand farmer hotline initiatives, and the emergence of mobile money and agfintech platforms. \nTaken together, NAFIR offers a package of transformative solutions that address the remaining \nconstraints to agri-finance scale-up while integrating and energising Ethiopia’s agri-finance \nlandscape after years of investment by government, private sector and development partners. \nIn so doing, NAFIR addresses agri-finance demand/supply gaps that are not only quantitative \n(insufficient overall lending) but also cyclical (availability at the right time), qualitative (products and \nservices not fulfilling beneficiary need) and distributional (credit not reaching those niches where it \nis needed). \nDiagram 1: The NAFIR Framework\nNAFIR\nScaling up Agri-Finance in Ethiopia\nNBE AGRI-FINANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\nDYNAMIC, SPECIALISED, DIGITALIZED AND DATA-DRIVEN AGRI-FINANCE LANDSCAPE\nDeepening Financial \nInclusion\nReﬁnancing and Risk-Sharing \nMechanism\nFarmer Access to Credit, \nSavings and Payments\nHub for coordination of \nStrategic Long-Term \nFrameworks\n•\nIncrease loanable funds for \nagriculture\n•\nReduce risk of ﬁnancing \nagriculture\n•\nCreates incentives for \nagri-lending\n•\nEnsure credit gets where it \nis needed and no-one gets \nlef behind \n•\nStreamlines FI farmer loan \ncompliance\n•\nReduce cost of ﬁnancing \nagriculture\n•\nBuilds comprehensive \nfarmer proﬁles\n•\n Integrates and makes \ntraceable the value chain\n•\nBuilds ﬁnancial literacy of \nborrowers\n•\nBuilds institutional capacity \nof FIs\n•\nFacilitates institutional \nlinkages\n•\nStrengthens agricultural risk \nmanagement \nModernizing \nAgriculture\nStrengthening Sectoral\nLinkage\nValue Addition & Export \nGrowth\nPILLAR I: NAFA\nPILLAR II: FAST\nPILLAR III: CoE\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n68\nThe framework that emerges offers a holistic, data -driven, incentives-based approach across its \nthree pillars. Pillars I and II address the identified structural constraints: NAFA increases loanable fund \navailability and reduces the risk of lending to agriculture; FAST streamlines compliance and reduces \nthe costs of financing the sector. CoE addresses the identified coordination constraints, building the \nfinancial literacy of borrowers and the institutional capacity of lenders, addressing both the demand- \nand supply-sides of the agri-finance landscape. \nA new policy instrument for mandated minimum lending to agriculture may be considered subject to \nadditional assessment44.\nGovernance of NAFIR implementation is recommended to take place through a steering \ncommittee co-chaired by the Governor of the NBE and the Minister of Agriculture. This \nmechanism will convene the key institutional actors supporting agri-finance in Ethiopia and is \nintended to drive a whole-of-government approach. A technical sub-committee would sit under the \nsteering committee. The steering committee would also oversee a project management unit housed \ninitially within the NBE to facilitate implementation. A NAFIR consultative body would comprise \ndemand- and supply-side stakeholders, development partners, and experts from academia and \ntechnical institutions. It would meet with the steering committee on a regular basis to review the \nprogress of NAFIR and identify enhancements.  \nGovernance of NAFIR implementation is recommended to take place through a steering \ncommittee comprising NBE, MoA, MoF, MoTRI, ATI, and National ID45. This mechanism \nconvenes the key institutional actors supporting agri-finance in Ethiopia and is intended to drive a \nwhole-of-government approach. The steering committee would oversee a project management unit \nthat would be housed initially within the NBE to undertake pre-implementation technical feasibility \nstudies and determine the institutional framework and technical design for implementation. A NAFIR \nconsultative body would comprise demand- and supply-side stakeholders, development partners \nand experts from academia and technical institutions, meeting with the steering committee on a \nregular basis to review the progress of NAFIR and identify enhancements. \nThe vision which emerges aligns closely with national policy frameworks. These include the \nfinancial deepening agenda under NFIS and NBE Strategy, the MoA TYAPP, and key objectives \narticulated in HGER, TYDP, and NAIP, in turn contributing to the SDGs and AU Agenda 2063.\nThe remainder of this section outlines the vision and rationale for each of the three NAFIR pillars.\n44\t This would take note that, while there is a 5% minimum requirement for lending against movable assets already \nin place, less than 1% of assets registered in Ethiopia’s Movable Property Security Registry (MPSR) are agricultural \nassets. Learning lessons from international experience, it is recommended that a minimum agri-credit lending \nrequirement, if introduced, would create maximum flexibility in how FIs could fulfil the requirement. FIs may on-lend \nthrough other FIs. They may provide credit that is intermediated via, for example, cooperatives, offtakers, agro-\ndealers, aggregators, warehouse operators, commodity exchanges, mobile money and agfintech platforms. They \nmay purchase loans from other FIs whose loan value exceeds the requirement and have surplus. This would create \na market-based incentive for FIs to aim as high as possible with their agri-loans and not stop once they reach the \nminimum requirement, spurring some FIs to specialise in agri-finance and boost rural presence, knowing these \ninvestments would be rewarded.\n45\t Additional participants may include the NFIS Council, Ministry of Education, and the electricity networks.\n\n69\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nPILLAR I:  \nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE ACCELERATOR (NAFA)\nNAFA will make available more loanable funds specifically \nearmarked for agriculture and lower the risks of financing \nthe sector. It will provide both the resources (new funds) and \nthe positive incentives (risk-sharing) for FIs to supply more agri-\ncredit. \nThe refinancing component of NAFA is designed to make \navailable a new source of loanable funds for FIs under an \ninclusive targeting framework. NAFA would act as a conduit \nfor pooling resources from government, development partners \nand private sources. It would channel the pooled resources to \nensure not only that they reach agriculture, but also that credit \nis available where it is needed the most – agri-borrower types, \nuse cases, value chains, regions, gender, and insurance – to \nmake sure that no-one gets left behind. Agri-lending would \nbe strengthened by application of consistent definitions and \ntagging of loans by identified sub-segments. \nNAFA will implement and scale incrementally based on ‘test and learn’ cycles targeting identified \nagricultural sub-sectors and regions meeting defined readiness criteria.\nThis approach is structured to crowd in and scale up private sector funding for agriculture, \nin line with the HGER policy emphasis for Ethiopia’s transition to a private sector-led growth \nmodel. When a FI originates an agri-loan that qualifies for refinancing and risk-sharing incentives \nthrough NAFA by addressing under-served segments defined in the inclusive targeting framework, \nthe FI refinances that loan by selling a portion of it to NAFA. That portion of the loan capital is \nthen received back by the FI and becomes available for originating new loans. The result is a risk-\nsharing arrangement in which NAFA bears the risk for the portion of the loan that it refinances, and \npotentially more. Selective pre-financing (credit lines) may also be offered as an additional incentive \nto reach under-served segments, subject to an organised and ready pipeline of validated borrowers \n(e.g. a contract farming scheme)46. NAFA refinancing will be issued on a first-come, first-served \nbasis. As NAFA-backed loans are repaid, the funds will revolve to become available for refinancing \nnew loans.\nIt is proposed that NAFA may also take a first loss position for loans provided to high priority \nand under-served segments through credit guarantee. This means that if losses arise from the \nloan, NAFA would bear those losses alone up to a defined amount. For loans that do not automatically \nqualify for first-loss risk-sharing, the option may be provided for the FI to pay a premium in return \nfor NAFA taking on first loss risk up to a defined amount. In line with well-established practice, the \npremium amount would be calculated scientifically based on a quantification of the underlying risk. \nOverall, this flexible approach to risk-sharing would give FIs the opportunity to carefully tailor how \nthey mitigate risk across their agri-finance portfolios.\nNAFA uses a data-driven, incentives-based approach for increasing the flow of credit not \nmerely to agriculture overall, but also to ensure it reaches the under-served segments where \nit is needed the most. \n46\t A key risk with pre-financing is that funds allocated under credit line may not be utilised or may be utilised slowly. In \nthe context of Ethiopia’s high systemic credit constraints, it is essential every Birr of additional funding for agriculture \nis put to work. It is therefore recommended that credit lines are provided on an exceptional basis for particularly \nunder-served segments, not as the norm, and only when the pipeline is already in place to allow for rapid \ndisbursement. \nReﬁnancing and Risk-Sharing \nMechanism\n•\nIncrease loanable funds for \nagriculture\n•\nReduce risk of ﬁnancing \nagriculture\n•\nCreates incentives for \nagri-lending\n•\nEnsure credit gets where it is \nneeded and no-one gets lef \nbehind \nPILLAR I: NAFA\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n70\n‘Levers’ that may incentivise distribution \nof agri-finance to under-served segments \ninclude47:\n• \nHigher proportion of total loan amount \nrefinanced;\n• \nLower cost of refinancing;\n• \nFull or part prefinancing through credit \nlines;\n• \nLower cost of prefinancing;\n• \nHigher level of risk sharing; and\n• \nFirst loss versus pari passu (equal \nsharing) risk position.\nAs agri-finance ecosystems mature, the proportion of credit provided direct by FIs to farmers \ntends to reduce as FIs use innovative channels to reach the farmer and overcome rural \ninfrastructure gaps. Therefore, while loans refinanced by NAFA may be originated by FIs directly \nto the farmer, they will also be encouraged to be provided indirectly through on-lending or pass-\nthrough arrangements via available channels such as: \n• \nOfftakers linked to contract farming arrangements which enable the financing of the farmer \nthrough their value chain relationships; \n• \nDigital platforms e.g. the ATI Input e-Voucher System (IVS), mobile money (e.g. TeleBirr/\nMPESA), and agfintech and digital platforms (e.g. Kifiya/Lersha/ Farm Pass); \n• \nInput distributors such as cooperatives, agro-dealers or ATI agricultural one stop shops (AOSS) \nwhich may provide famers with crop inputs, animal feed and health products on credit; \n• \nEquipment vendors or mechanisation service providers which may provide goods and services \nto the farmers on credit; and \n• \nWarehouse operators which may disburse credit to the farmer on behalf of the FI, secured \nagainst the farmer’s outputs stored in a professionally-managed warehouse.\nThe combination of refinancing with risk-sharing through NAFA has been recommended over \nother possible approaches. \n47\t The levers may be adjusted to optimise agri-finance distribution based on continuous analysis of the elasticities and \ncross-elasticities of agri-credit provision in response to changes in one or more levers for a given borrower type.\nBox 13: \nHypothetical Examples – How incentive levers \nmay be used to stimulate the flow of agri-\nfinance to under-served segments\nHypothetical Example 1:\nCommercial cash crop farmer near Addis Ababa: \n10 percent refinancing at refinancing base interest \nrate, with no risk sharing. \nHypothetical Example 2: \n Smallholder grain farmer in rural center (e.g., Arsi): \n50 percent refinancing at refinancing base rate \nminus 20 percent, with 75 percent risk share. \nHypothetical Example 3: \nLowland pastoralist: 75 percent refinancing at \nrefinancing base rate minus 50 percent, with 80 \npercent first loss” \n\n71\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nTable 10: Comparison of NAFIR versus Alternative Approached for Scaling-Up Agri-Finance\nModel\nDescription\nComparison versus NAFA\nAgri Policy Bank\nA public institution \nthat resolves the \nloanable fund \nresource constraints \nby directly providing \nagri-loans to \nproducers, rather \nthan refinancing agri-\nloans originated by \nother FIs.\nAn agri policy bank may result in the centralization of \nagri-credit supply, crowding out the private sector, and \ndampening the dynamism and innovation that results \nfrom competition. Under NAFA, loan origination – and \nthe customer relationship – stays with the FIs so that \nNAFA crowds in private sector credit. This is especially \nimportant for aligning NAFA with the HGER objective \nfor Ethiopia to “transition from a public to a private \nsector-led growth model”. It also creates competition \namong FIs for the farmer’s busines to create a more \ndynamic, innovative and farmer-responsive landscape. \nAn agri policy bank will also experience sectoral \nconcentration which may challenge risk management \nand prudent operation best practices, whereas a \nrefinancing mechanism diversifies through the range \nof FIs that originate loans. However, there is scope over \ntime for a specialised agri-bank to be introduced on \na fully commercial basis, including as a public-private \npartnership blending government and private sector \ninvestment.\nRisk-sharing only\nThis is the approach \nin countries such as  \nNigeria and Ghana \nthrough a national \nvehicle that provides \nrisk-sharing but not \nrefinancing.\nA national risk-sharing facility, as a standalone approach, \nwould not address the constraint in loanable fund \naccess that holds back the scaling up of FI credit flow \nto agriculture. NAFA complements risk-sharing with \na refinancing component. This is necessary to bridge \nthe resources gap which has been identified as a key \nconstraint in the Ethiopian context by stakeholders (see \nChart 18 above).\nFI-specific Credit \nLines and Risk \nSharing Facilities \n(RSF)\nRelying on FIs to \nsource their own \ncredit lines and RSFs \nto resolve their own \nresource constraints.\nRelying on FIs to source their own credit lines and risk-\nsharing facilities is important and will be supported \nthrough NAFIR. However, it would not – as a short-\nterm standalone measure – result in a systematic and \ncoordinated solution to ensure sufficient capital is raised \nto meet national policy targets or that credit reaches \nwhere it is needed to make sure that no one gets left \nbehind.\nNAFA would be integrated closely with the existing components of Ethiopia’s agri-finance \nlandscape for a coordinated scale-up of credit to meet policy ambitions.  NAFA Integration \nand Scalability Plans would be developed by the ‘landscape enablers’ – registries, initiatives, \nprogrammes, etc – across both the financial and real sectors which drive fulfilment of each agri-\nfinance use case. These would set out the actions required from each landscape enabler to build \nthe necessary capacity so that the landscape can support more farmers, more transactions, more \nlocations and more value chains. \n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n72\nThree additional incentives for scaling-up agri-finance are proposed under NAFA: \nAdditional Incentive 1:  NAFA Eligibility Requirements\nFIs benefiting from NAFA refinancing and risk sharing would meet distributional and qualitative \neligibility requirements:\n• \nDistributional eligibility requirements would apply at the level of the loan. To qualify, agri-\nloans would need to be provided for an eligible agri-finance use case, value chain, borrower \ntype, region, gender, or for agro- and livestock insurance, linked to FAST (see below). \n• Qualitative eligibility requirements would apply at the level of the FI. FIs would need to meet \nminimum requirements for specialised agri-finance product design, emphasis on promoting \nagricultural assets as movable collateral as well as use of alternative data, robust loan lifecycle \nprocedures, and the application of fair commercially-based interest rates and fees to assure the \naffordability of credit for the farmer.\nThese distributional and qualitative eligibility requirements would create incentives for FIs to \nimprove the distribution and quality of agri-finance offered in the country. These requirements \nwould create incentives for FIs to design specialised, farmer-inclusive and competitive agri-finance \nproducts backed by dedicated  in-house agri-finance capability, supported with the provision of \ncapacity-building services by the CoE (see below).\nAdditional Incentive 2: League Tables, Awards and Preferences\nFI agri-finance performance would be closely monitored. High-performing FIs, and innovators \nwould be recognised in an annual awards ceremony. Preferences would be established for high \nperforming FIs – e.g. through government and development partner financing and project \nopportunities – to reward good performance. \nAdditional Incentive 3: Contract Farming and IAIPs\nIt is recommended to make a special provision under NAFA to support loans provided by FIs to \nofftakers that enter into contract farming arrangements and participate in Ethiopia’s IAIPs. This \nwould incentivise the uptake of both initiatives, linked to their respective policy frameworks, and \nhelp achieve national policy objectives of strengthening sectoral linkages between agriculture and \nindustry, value addition and export growth.\nThese form part of a comprehensive package of incentives for demand- and supply-side \nactors under NAFIR overall.\nDiagram 2: Comprehensive Incentives Framework within the NAFIR Framework\nNAFIR\nScaling up Agri-Finance in Ethiopia\nDEMAND SIDE INCENTIVES\n•FAST usage enables farmer access to \naﬀordable credit and insurance\n•FAST usage and good performance leads to \nhigher credit allowance for the farmer\n•High performing ‘champion farmers’ receive \nextra traning and rewards\n•Oﬀtakers engaged in contract farming and \nIAIPs receive aﬀordable credit through NAFA \nto strengthen sectoral linkages\n•NAFA reﬁnances FI agri-loans to quickly access \nmore funds\n•NAFA shares risk on agri-loans, with higher risk \nthrough ﬁrst loss position on high priority and \nunder served segments\n•NAFA reﬁnance and risk sharing is subject to \ngood product and process design\n•Recognition on FI high-performers and \ninnovators through annual awards\n•Performances for high-performers through \naccess to government and development project \nopportunities\n•Rating system unlocks credit line access for \nhigh performers\nSUPPLY SIDE INCENTIVES\n\n73\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nNAFA is intended as a time-bound approach to catalyse the initial scale up while accompanied \nby longer-term measures that further increase loanable funds availability for agriculture over \ntime.\n• \nBuilding Readiness for Credit Lines: \nNBE, in consultation with relevant \nstakeholders, would co-design and \nimplement a framework for a ratings \nsystem covering commercial banks, \nMFIs, and capital goods financing \ncompanies. \nA separate set of ratings would be \nintroduced for RuSACCOs and APCs, \nleveraging global cooperative sector \nassessment methodologies such as \nSCOPEinsight48.\nThe ratings system would serve to create transparency on FI creditworthiness for the benefit of \ncredit line providers to assess potential partnerships and transactions. To achieve higher credit \nratings, FIs and cooperatives would need to improve their financial and operational performance. \nAchieving high credit ratings would facilitate stronger institutional linkages, building improved \naccess for Ethiopian FIs to credit lines from international sources, and for MFIs, RuSACCOs to \ncredit lines and on-lending facilities from banks. This intervention would be complemented by \na dedicated ‘linkages’ hub within the CoE to facilitate partnerships, disseminate information, \nstudy and share best practices, and monitor progress.\n• \nInter-Bank Markets: Inter-bank markets would enable the trading of available loanable funds \nfor agri-credit among FIs so these funds reach those institutions best placed to originate new \nagri-loans.\n• \nAgro-Securitisation: Over time, NAFA would sell on a portion of its loans into the capital \nmarkets via agro-securities listed on ESX. This would achieve two objectives: firstly, to unlock an \nadditional scalable funding source for NAFA itself; and secondly, to catalyse the development \nof Ethiopia’s agro-securitisation market to enable wider access by Ethiopia’s FIs to the capital \nmarkets for overcoming their own resourcing constraints.\nPILLAR II:  \nFARMER ACCESS TO STREAMLINED FINANCIAL SERVICES (FAST)\nFAST is a mechanism for rapid farmer access to financial \nservices via a mix of mediums that may include physical \nor digital credit cards, QR codes, agent-based and other \noffline solutions applicable to context.  It is proposed that \nall farmers with a land-holding registered in the MoA’s NRLAIS \nregistry, and pastoralists with an animal registered in the MoA’s \nEthLITS registry, would be eligible for FAST. A FAST unique \nidentifier would be linked to a named farmer, Fayda ID number, \nfarm plot and/or tagged livestock in MoA databases, cellphone \nnumber where available, and provide a digital wallet for the \nfarmer to facilitate digital payments for goods and services, \nreceive sales proceeds, and make savings.

The aim is to cut out entirely the need for \nfarmers to submit compliance documentation to the FI, eliminating large amounts of paperwork, \nprocessing effort, and time delay. \nThe implementation of FAST would be managed in partnership with the National ID, MoA, \nATI and ECC, closely linked to the imminent rural roll-out of National ID. National ID is \nresponsible for issuance of the Fayda unique identifier along with physical and digital cards. It \nwill shortly commence its rural rollout, reaching millions of farmers during 2025 itself and tens \nof millions in 2026 and subsequent years. National ID has already integrated its systems with the \nMoA’s land registry database, which is understood to cover 18 million farmers. This links the Fayda \nunique identifier with essential farm data such as geolocation, plot size and crop mix. National ID \nis also shortly to introduce a digital credentials wallet which will allow for a farmer’s FAST unique \nidentifier credential to sit alongside the Fayda identifier and others (e.g. driving licenses, social \nprotection programmes) offering a readily accessible and interoperable technology backbone for \nimplementation of FAST. The MoA, through its Rural Finance Unit and Agri-Stack Project, will also \nplay an important role building the real sector enabling environment for scaling-up agri-finance, \nwhile ATI, through its key initiatives50, as well as ECC will help integrate FAST with efficient ‘last \nmile’ delivery systems for inputs, equipment and mechanisation services that reach the farmer \neven in remote rural areas.\nAn automated, centrally developed credit-scoring algorithm would generate a personalised \nseasonal credit allowance for each farmer, linked to their FAST identifier. The algorithm would \nbe jointly developed by the FIs under NBE auspices, similar to how FIs collaborated with mobile \nmoney platforms to develop credit-scoring algorithms embedded in those platforms to support \ndigital micro-lending. The algorithm would calculate each farmer’s seasonal credit allowance \naccording to the farmer’s need – based on factors such as farm plot size, crop mix, and production \ncost – as well as market price to assess the affordability of credit, and past performance. The \ncredit allowance would be sub-allocated to different use case ‘windows’ for crop inputs, irrigation, \nmechanisation, livestock, outputs and insurance, and would be pre-cleared for NAFA refinancing \nand risk-sharing to closely link farmer access with FI incentive. A credit allocation for non-farm and \nhousehold purposes may also be provided, recognising that many producer households engage in \nnon-agricultural activities. Gender-intentionality would be incorporated into the credit allocations, \nrecognising the specific needs and challenges facing women farmers.\nThe credit allowance would evolve over time. It would be raised for those farmers that provide \ntimely repayment, as well as for farmers that meet specified performance targets, e.g. yield gain, PHL \nreduction, CSA uptake, etc. This would act not only as an incentive for good performance but also \nto catalyse increased on-farm investment by the higher-performing farmers into, e.g. diversification, \nfarm expansion, sustainable land management, advanced farm equipment, aggregation and \nstorage systems, and would enable every farmer to advance at their own pace. This incentive will \nbe supplemented by recognition of ‘champion farmers’ – those farmers best able to take, repay \n49\t Likely to include NRLAIS, EthLITS, the CRB and woreda-level systems.\n50\t Including agricultural commercialisation clusers (ACC), agricultural one-stop shops (AOSS), the input e-voucher \nsystem (IVS) and the 8028 farmer hotline.\n\n75\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nand convert agri-credit into farm-level investment and performance improvement – and offer \nthem additional training, goods and services that will facilitate further advancements.\nAll credit allocations to the farmer would be pre-cleared as eligible for NAFA refinancing \nand risk-sharing to closely link farmer access with FI incentive. Any FI may provide credit to \nthe farmer and receive NAFA refinancing and risk-sharing, subject to meeting qualitative eligibility \nrequirements (see above). This means that FIs would need to compete for the farmer’s business, \nwith the intent that competition can stimulate dynamism and innovation, and lead to the reduction \nof rates and fees.\nAs a condition of access to credit through FAST, crop or livestock insurance would automatically \nbe taken. This would enable insurance to be bundled with credit, refinanced by NAFA on a risk-\nsharing basis, and repaid out of the farmer’s sales proceeds along with other credit the farmer takes \nvia FAST. As a result, crop and livestock insurance would become more affordable for the farmer \nand create the conditions for significant growth in farmer uptake, with the economies of scale and \nefficiencies of distribution driving prospective reduction in insurance premium cost, and with a \nstrategy in place to systematically raise awareness and provide education to farmers.\nAlso as a condition of access to credit through FAST, the farmer would need to use their FAST \nidentifier when making or receiving digital payments related to agro-input, mechanisation \nand output transactions. \n•\t\nThe use of FAST for procuring agro-inputs and mechanisation equipment or services would \nprovide assurance that the farmer is using credit for the intended purposes and create an audit \ntrail of the farmer’s input and equipment use over time. \n•\t\nThe use of FAST to receive the sales proceeds from the farmer’s output marketing would enable \nloan repayments to be deducted from the farmer’s sales proceeds and create an audit trail of \nthe farmer’s marketable surplus and income over time. \nThose farmers that use the FAST consistently for digital payments linked to input, mechanisation \nand output transactions would be rewarded through higher credit limits, while those that do not \ncomply would see their credit limits reduced and, in the event of loan default or persistent non-\ncompliance, withdrawn. In so doing, the FAST would also serve to deter and detect side-selling \nagainst contract farming commitments, providing a stimulus for contract farming and related VCF \nlending. \nWith the farmer’s output marketing transactions systematically recorded, FAST would create \ntraceability of the flow of goods along the value chain. In so doing, FAST would also serve \nto deter and detect ‘side-selling’ against contract farming commitments, providing a stimulus for \ncontract farming and related value chain finance (VCF)-based lending. This would help to strengthen \nvalue chain relationships, integrate farmers into the formal economy, and provide opportunities for \ndigitalising revenue collection by government linked to the ‘Digital Ethiopia 2025’ national digital \ntransformation strategy. To strengthen sectoral linkages between agriculture and industry and \ncreate the absorptive capacity for the offtake of increased farm-level output, a special provision for \nNAFA refinancing and risk-sharing would be made for loans to offtakers that participate in contract \nfarming arrangements and IAIPs. This would create incentives for closer relationships between \nproducers and offtakers and create a stimulus for value addition and export growth.\nData from FAST would feed into a National Agri-Finance Database (NAFID), building \na comprehensive profile for each farmer to drive bankability and a surge in farm-level \ninvestment. The farmer profile would comprise:\n\t\n■\nFarmer identity\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n76\n\t\n■\nFarm data\n\t\n■\nMarketing track record\n\t\n■\nFinancial history.\nFAST-collected transactional data may be supplemented over time by on-farm monitoring, for \nexample by extension officers, agfintech platform agents or remote monitoring technologies, to \nmeasure farm performance (e.g. productivity, water efficiency, PHL), enabling comprehensive \ntracking of progress towards agricultural modernisation by value chain and region. Importantly, the \nNAFID database, and the data-sharing protocols linked to it, would be protected by best practice \ndata security and consumer protection frameworks.\nThe operations of FAST would become self-sustaining. Usage of FAST would generate fees \nincurred by the FI set at a minute proportion of the transaction value. \nPILLAR III:\t\nAGRI-FINANCE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE (CoE)\nThe CoE is intended as a hub for stakeholder coordination, \nimplementation and monitoring in the areas of financial \nliteracy, FI and regulatory capacity development, \nagricultural risk management and FI linkages. \nIts purpose is to supersede approaches which in the past \nmay have been fragmented, small-scale and program-\nspecific with strategic and coherent frameworks which are \nsystematic, coordinated and have long-term continuity, \nbacked by a Technical Assistance Facility (TAF).\nThe CoE would be structured to have regional outreach to \ncover the country as a whole, and would be tasked with four \naction areas:\nCoE Action Area One: National Agri-Finance Literacy (NAFIL) Framework\nThe CoE would oversee development and delivery of a national framework for agri-financial literacy, \nand related digital literacy, under the National Financial Education Strategy (NFES). \nNAFIL would include, among others, a segmented stakeholder needs assessment, a gap analysis, \nand the scoping and development of relevant content necessary to build the financial and digital \nliteracy of producers and cooperatives to successfully absorb and put to effective use agri-finance \nacross the different use cases and value chains. \nNAFIL would be delivered smartly to farmers and cooperatives by integrating it with the roll-out \nof NAFA and FAST, to improve efficiency, inclusivity and cost-effectiveness. It may be delivered \nthrough the following proposed structure:\n\t\n■\nInception Workshops: farmers would participate in a kebele-level workshop at the time \nof collecting their FAST identifier. The workshop would carefully explain how FAST works, \nthe conditions associated with its usage, and provide financial and digital literacy training \ncustomised according to the kebele’s agricultural profile. Financial and digital literacy training \nmay be delivered by the CoE in collaboration with National ID, MoA, ATI and ECC. FIs having \npresence or coverage in the area would be invited to participate. \n\t\n■\nAnnual update workshops ahead of the season in which farmers would be individually \ninformed of their updated FAST credit allowance, high-performing agri-finance ‘champion \nfarmers’ would be recognised and rewarded, refresher information would be provided on FAST, \nCoordinates Strategic \nLong-Term Frameworks\n•\nBuilds ﬁnacial literacy of \nagri-borrowers\n•\nBuilds institutional capacity of FIs\n•\nFacilitates institutional linkages\n•\nStrengthens agriculture risk \nmanagement\nPILLAR III: CoE\n\n77\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nand follow-on financial and digital literacy training would be provided. \n\t\n■\nPush Messages & Helpdesk: Farmers would receive customised financial and digital literacy \nmessages by SMS and/or interactive voice response (IVR), in association with the ATI’s 8028 \nHotline, with message content tailored to the farmers’ crop selection, agro-ecological zone, \nand the time of the season, and integrated with a wider set of messages containing agro-\nclimatic advisory information. The helpdesk functionality under the 8028 Hotline would be \nreinforced so that farmers can access financial and digital literacy experts and ask questions \nabout FAST, and agri-finance opportunities more generally.\n\t\n■\nAdvanced Workshops: farmers would qualify for additional training through special ‘agri-\nfinance champion farmer’ workshops according to their achievement of performance targets. \nThis will further help to recognise good performance, enable those farmers with capacity and \nreadiness to advance further, and thereby encourage farm-level investment.\nCoE Action Area Two:  FI and Regulatory Capacity Development\nThe CoE would support FIs to introduce specialised agri-finance products and build up their in-\nhouse specialised agri-finance capability by developing best practice principles, guidelines and \ntemplates, backed by training and capacity-building services. It would also support FI development \nof Interest Free Banking (IFB) equivalent agri-finance products to address the needs of Muslim \nborrowers. The CoE would run competitions to stimulate agri-finance and agfintech innovations, \nproviding technical support for early implementation and related capacity-building. Importantly, \nthe CoE would offer differentiated approaches by FI type, and enable a renewed focus on agri-\nfinance by the MFI sector, as well as the converted MFIs now licensed as banks, so the proportion \nof MFI credit provided to agriculture may reverse its current downward trajectory. Special provision \nwould be made for capacity-building to financial sector regulatory authorities to ensure adequate \nknowledge, understanding and skills are in place to effectively regulate the new environment.\nCoE Action Area Three: Institutional linkages\nThe CoE would serve as a Hub for Agri-Finance Institutional Linkages (HAFIL), building improved \naccess for Ethiopian FIs to credit lines from international sources, and for MFIs and RuSACCOs to \ncredit lines and on-lending facilities from banks. A further linkage facilitated by HAFIL would be \nbetween FIs and DFS solutions providers, including mobile money and agfintech platforms, to drive \nforward digital transformation in agriculture. The CoE’s role would be to facilitate partnerships, \ndisseminate information, study and share best practices, and monitor progress. The CoE would \nsynergise with the proposed ratings system covering FIs and cooperatives noted above.\nInstitutional linkages would also be incentivised through NAFA and the FAST in the following ways: \n\t\n■\nFirstly, credit to agriculture delivered by FIs through indirect channels – e.g. mobile money \nand agfintech platforms51, ATI-supported ACCs, AOSS and the IVS – would not only be \neligible but also may be rewarded through higher levels of NAFA refinancing and risk-sharing, \nbased on the efficiencies these channels create52. \n\t\n■\nSecondly, intermediated financing – i.e. finance that reaches a producer via offtakers, \ncooperatives, agro dealers and warehouse operators – would also be eligible and may be \nsimilarly rewarded with higher levels of NAFA refinancing and risk-sharing, based on the risk \nreduction these approaches offer to the lender. \n51\t  Including both FI proprietary platforms as well as third party platforms.\n52\t Farmers would use the FAST to access this credit, but the credit would come through the indirect channel or \nintermediary.\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n78\nCoE Action Area Four:Agriculture Risk Management\nAn Agriculture Risk Management Permanent Working Group under the CoE would be formed which \nwould cohesively address the range of challenges facing the scale-up of agricultural insurance in \nthe country, including policy, regulation, strategy, capacity, product design, distribution and cost: \nThe Working Group would have two broad objectives:\n To integrate crop and livestock insurance within the NAFA/FAST framework. This would \nenable insurance to be bundled with credit, refinanced by NAFA, and repaid out of the farmer’s \nsales proceeds along with other credit the farmer takes via FAST. As a result, crop and livestock \ninsurance would become more affordable for the farmer and create the conditions for improved \nfarmer uptake. \n\t\n■\nTo develop and implement a national policy framework and strategy for agricultural \nrisk management, including components on crop and livestock insurance and price risk \nmanagement:\no Initial focus – crop and livestock insurance: The objective will be to support scaling up \nof crop and livestock insurance, building on the four Dialogue Platform Meetings that took \nplace under the JICA ICIP project between May 2022 and January 2024, while linking to \nongoing initiatives such as the MoA/UNDP-led IRFF and the ATI/WFP partnership linked to \nthe ARC, and addressing new developments including the prospective establishment of an \ninsurance regulator, and enhancing the institutional distribution arrangements for insurance \nin the country.\no  Medium-term focus – price risk management: Price risk management solutions are \nnot yet available in Ethiopia today, even though FIs cite price volatility as a significant risk \nthat constrains agri-lending. An agricultural price risk management strategy would be \ndeveloped under which solutions would be gradually introduced, such as hedging tools \noffered by domestic and international commodity exchanges, and actuarial solutions. Based \non these experiences, a national programme framework for price risk management would \nbe developed before the end of the first NAFIR period in 2030.\n\n79\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n8. \nANNEX\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n80\nANNEX I – NAFIR IN PRACTICE\nThis section sets out an illustration of how NAFIR could work in practice, looking at three prospective \nfinancing scenarios.\nScenario 1: Direct FI-Provided Credit \nIn this scenario, a bank, MFI or RuSACCO provides credit direct to the farmer via FAST and receives \nrefinancing and risk-sharing from NAFA. The financing is secured against the farmer’s land via the \nSLLC registered in NRLAIS or a pastoralist’s animal(s) registered in EthLITS, with these assets in turn \nbeing registered in the MPSR collateral registry. Crop or livestock insurance is taken automatically \nafter the first draw-down by the farmer. If the farmer stores goods in the warehouse and takes WRF \nagainst the stored goods, the WRF proceeds may be used to repay the input and equipment loan, \nand the transaction is secured against the warehouse receipt issued either by the NWRS or ECX \nand registered in the MPSR collateral registry.\nTable 11: Activity Flow under Direct-FI Provided Credit via FAST and NAFA\nNo\nActivity\nDescription\n1\nCredit-Score\nFAST algorithm sets farmer credit allowance based on farmer needs and track \nrecord\n2\nApproach\nThe farmer approaches an FI – a bank, MFI, or RuSACCO – for credit\n3\nPresentation\nThe farmer presents their FAST identifier to the FI at the branch, to a field agent, \nor online\n4\nValidation\nThe FI validates the cardholder’s identity via Fayda National ID\n5\nAccess\nThe FI uses the FAST identifier to access the farmer’s information53\n6\nApproval\nThe FI approves the credit same day, against the FAST-defined credit allowance\n7\nAllocation\nCredit is loaded onto the FAST wallet and allocated to different ‘use case’ \nwindows54\n8\nRecordal\nThe loan is recorded in NAFID, and specified as the Direct FI-Provided modality\n9\nLien\nA lien is registered in MPSR, NRLAIS and EthLITS over the farmer’s SLLC and \nanimals\n10\nInsurance\nCrop or livestock insurance55 is automatically taken to cover the farmer’s \nproduction\n11\nDraw-down\nThe farmer uses the FAST wallet, at the appropriate time of the season, to: \n\t\n■\nPay for crop inputs / feed / animal health products at approved56 agro-dealers\n\t\n■\nPay for equipment57 (e.g irrigation, farm implements) with approved providers\n\t\n■\nPay for mechanisation services with approved providers\n\t\n■\nUse storage at an WRS-approved warehouse and receive output finance\n\t\n■\nPay for miscellaneous items for non-farm and household purposes up to a \nlimit\n53\t This includes all farmer profile necessary for loan approval per updated NBE regulations (i.e. national ID number, \nNRLAIS farm data, EthLITS livestock data, required Woreda-level systems data), plus data extracted from NAFID \nincluding farmer identity, farm plot, marketing track record, and financial history.\n54\t I.e. inputs, irrigation, mechanisation, outputs, insurance, non-farm purposes\n55\t Subject to FI preferences, other insurance – e.g. life and health cover – may also be applied\n56\t Each use case window would only be permitted to be spent with an approved provider of the relevant services\n57\t Equipment would not be purchased each year but for the expected lifetime of the asset\n\n81\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n12\nRefinancing\nEach draw-down is recorded in NAFID.

As \nabove, the FI receives refinancing and risk-sharing via NAFA; the loan would be secured against \nthe farmer’s land via the SLLC registered in NRLAIS or a pastoralist’s animal(s) registered in EthLITS, \nwith these assets in turn being registered in the MPSR collateral registry; and crop or livestock \ninsurance is automatically taken with the first draw down.\nIf the offtaker permits deferred delivery, then the farmer may store the goods in a warehouse and \ntake WRF against the stored goods. As above, the WRF proceeds may then be used to repay the \ninput and equipment loan, and the transaction is secured against the warehouse receipt issued \neither by the NWRS or ECX and registered in the MPSR collateral registry, pending sale and delivery \nof the goods to the offtaker.\nTable 12: Activity Flow under FAST-Based Value Chain Finance linked to Contract Farming\nNo\nActivity\nDescription\n1\nCredit-Score\nFAST algorithm sets farmer credit allowance based on farmer needs and track \nrecord\n2\nAgreement\nAn offtaker enters into agreement with an FI prior to contracting with farmers\n3\nDisbursement\nThe FI disburses funds to the offtaker. \n4\nPresentation\nThe farmer presents their FAST identifier to the offtaker at the depot, to a field \nagent, or online\n5\nValidation\nThe offtaker validates the cardholder’s identity via Fayda National ID\n6\nAccess\nThe offtaker uses the FAST identifier to access the farmer’s information\n7\nContracting\nThe offtaker enters into a contract with the farmer, specifying the goods and \nservices to be financed and their value, and the farmer’s obligation to deliver \noutputs\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n82\n8\nRecordal\nThe contract is recorded in NAFID, and specified as the Offtaker-Provided \nmodality\n9\nPurchase\nThe offtaker purchases inputs and equipment at the appropriate time of the \nseason\n10\nProvision\nThe offtaker provides the farmer, at the appropriate time of the season, with: \n\t\n■\nInputs / feed / animal health products\n\t\n■\nEquipment\n\t\n■\nServices \n\t\n■\nMiscellaneous items for non-farm and household purposes up to a limit\n11\nInsurance\nCrop or livestock insurance58 is automatically taken to cover the farmer’s \nproduction\n12\nLien\nA lien is registered in MPSR, NRLAIS and EthLITS over the farmer’s SLLC and \nanimals\n13 \nDraw Down\nThe farmer’s receipt of goods and services, and their value, is deducted from \nthe FAST wallet against the farmer’s credit allocation under each ‘use case’ \nwindow\n14\nRefinancing\nEach draw-down is recorded in NAFID.

Variants \nof this arrangement could include:\n•\t\nA digital platform (e.g. mobile money, agfintech) which provides various financial products and \nservices to the farmer;\n•\t\nA cooperative, agro-dealer or AOSS (ATI) which provides famers with crop inputs, feed or animal \nhealth products on credit;\n•\t\nAn equipment vendor or mechanisation service provider which provides goods and services to \nthe farmers on credit; and\n•\t\nA warehouse operator which disburses WRF to the farmer on behalf of the FI, secured against \nthe farmer’s outputs stored in a professionally-managed warehouse.\n58\t\n Subject to FI preferences, other insurance – e.g. life and health cover – may also be applied\n\n83\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\nIn some cases, all the agri-finance use cases may be fulfilled by agri-finance products and services \nprovided through one intermediating entity. \nIn other cases – for example, through an agro-dealer, equipment vendor, mechanisation service \nprovider or warehouse operator – one or several but not all the use cases may be fulfilled by agri-\nfinance products and services provided through that intermediating entity.  Accordingly, it may be \nthat the farmer receives finance via multiple intermediating entities. \nIn the table below, these entities are referred to as intermediaries, as they are intermediating the \nprovision of agri-finance. However, this terminology is not intended to imply they are intermediating \nthe purchase of outputs from the farmer.\nTable 13: Activity Flow under FAST-Based Intermediated Credit\nNo\nActivity\nDescription\n1\nCredit-Score\nFAST algorithm sets farmer credit allowance based on farmer needs and track \nrecord\n2\nAgreement\nThe intermediary enters into agreement with an FI \n3\nDisbursement\nThe FI disburses funds to the intermediary to purchase stock/equipment/\nservices\n4\nPresentation\nThe farmer presents their FAST identifier to the intermediary\n5\nValidation\nThe intermediary entity validates the cardholder’s identity via Fayda National ID\n6\nAccess\nThe intermediary uses the FAST identifier to access the farmer’s information\n7\nContracting\nThe intermediary enters into a contract with the farmer, specifying the goods \nand services to be financed and their value\n8\nRecordal\nThe contract is recorded in NAFID, and specified as the Intermediary-Provided \nmodality\n9\nPurchase\nThe intermediary purchases applicable inputs, equipment and/or services at \nthe appropriate time of the season\n10\nProvision\nThe intermediary provides the farmer, at the appropriate time of the season, \nwith goods or services on credit: \n•\t\nInputs / feed / animal health products\n•\t\nEquipment\n•\t\nServices \n•\t\nMiscellaneous items for non-farm or household purposes up to a maximum \nlimit\n11\nInsurance\nCrop or livestock insurance59 is automatically taken to cover the farmer’s \nproduction\n12\nLien\nA lien is registered in MPSR, NRLAIS and EthLITS over the farmer’s SLLC and \nanimals\n59\t\n Subject to FI preferences, other insurance – e.g. life and health cover – may also be applied\n\nNATIONAL AGRI-FINANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP 2025-30\n84\nNo\nActivity\nDescription\n13 \nDraw Down\nThe farmer’s receipt of goods and services, and their value, is deducted from \nthe FAST wallet against the farmer’s credit allocation under each ‘use case’ \nwindow\n14\nRefinancing\nEach draw-down is recorded in NAFID.
