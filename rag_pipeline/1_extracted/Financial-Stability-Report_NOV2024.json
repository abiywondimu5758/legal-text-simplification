SUMMARY\nNational Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) issues this second Financial Stability Report in \naccordance with its responsibility to uphold a sound ﬁnancial system in Ethiopia. The \nreport aims to promote ﬁnancial stability in the country by examining developments \nand risks in the ﬁnancial sector as well as the broader economy during the course of \nthe past year. It is the second annual Financial Stability Report to be published by \nNBE and covers the period to June 2024 1, but it also addresses some major reforms \nand their eﬀects in the period July to September 2024. In addition, it provides an \noutlook on issues potentially aﬀecting the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system in the \nremainder of 2024 and 2025.\nThe report examines external developments and risks to the economy and ﬁnancial \nsector posed by the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and other global shocks. It \nalso highlights domestic factors, including the potential impacts of droughts and \nconﬂicts in parts of Ethiopia, and risks emanating from the ﬁnancial industry’s \nstructure. In addition, the report assesses the limitations and contributions of the \nﬁnancial sector’s infrastructure to its overall stability. The report provides a \ncomprehensive analysis of the risks and resilience of Ethiopia’s banking sector, which \nstill accounts for 96 percent of the ﬁnancial sector’s total assets as of June 2024.\nAccording to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Planning and Development, \nfollowing growth of 8.1 percent in 2023-24, the Ethiopian economy is expected to \ngrow by 8.4 percent in 2024-25. The continued implementation of various \nmacroeconomic, structural, and supply-side reforms under the second Homegrown \nEconomic Reform (HGER 2.0) is expected to support higher growth and ease \ninﬂation over the medium term. Likewise, a signiﬁcant expansion in social and capital \nspending by government is envisaged over the coming year, without much \ndeterioration in the ﬁscal deﬁcit, thanks to considerably improved revenue \ncollections and a resumption in the inﬂux of donor grants and loans.  On the inﬂation \nfront, continued tight monetary policies as well as strong agricultural output are \nanticipated to lead to gradually declining inﬂation over the course of 2025, despite a \nmoderate and temporary spike that is likely over the coming months due to \nexchange rate pass-through eﬀects. On the balance of payments front, a signiﬁcant \nimprovement in the external position — including much improved foreign exchange \nreserves — is anticipated due to the recent exchange rate adjustment, a declining \nThe report is based on oﬃcial data for Ethiopia’s ﬁscal year up to the end of June 2024, but it incorporates,     \nwhere appropriate, more recent data up to October 2024.\n1\n1\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\ntrade deﬁcit, increased remittances, and rising capital inﬂows from oﬃcial and \nprivate sector sources.  Taken together, while the macroeconomic environment has \nshown broadly improving trends over the past year and is expected to show ongoing \nimprovement over the course of 2025, potential headwinds are possible from policy \neﬀorts to reduce still-high inﬂation, security risks, and commodity price volatility.\nEthiopia’s banking sector remains stable and resilient. Risks in the reporting period \nwere mostly moderate and stable, although the outlook overall points to increasing \nrisk levels for ﬁnancial institutions due to external and domestic developments; \nnevertheless, the systemic risk-level remains limited. Credit risk is lower than the high \ncredit concentration suggests, because loans to the private sector are relatively \ndiversiﬁed. In addition, the credit risk stress test shows that even a severe shock \nwould not pose a systemic threat. The banking industry as a whole is also found to \nexhibit low liquidity risk and shows resilience to short-term liquidity shocks, despite \nsome downside risks. Conversely, operational risks are signiﬁcant in the banking \nindustry and are expected to rise further in the short and medium term, with incidents \nof fraud, social engineering, insider threats and third-party risks on the rise. \nWith respect to market and foreign exchange risks, except for a few heavily aﬀected \nﬁnancial institutions, the banking sector has also performed well during the \nadjustment of the birr exchange rate reform in July 2024.  \nConsidering these various threats to ﬁnancial stability, NBE directives have been \nissued in 2024 to reduce observed risks and to improve the resilience of banks to \nshocks in a number of areas. In particular, beyond the system-wide risks, directives \nput in place recently by NBE have sought to prevent and contain risks in key areas \nsuch as governance, asset classiﬁcation, lending to individuals with signiﬁcant \ninﬂuence, large exposures, and related party lending. NBE also continues to work \nwith individual banks that are more exposed to these challenges, and struggle to \ncope with bank-speciﬁc risks. \nIn the microﬁnance sector, the capital adequacy ratio, and liquidity ratio are all well \nwithin NBE’s parameters and have improved over the course of the review period. \nThe capital goods ﬁnance sector’s risk rating is moderate, with low capital risk and \nmoderate ratings for asset quality and systemic risk. \n2\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\nThe insurance sector also remains resilient overall, but earnings and concentration \nrisks are rated as high and may call for regulatory actions. Tighter regulatory \nstandards on credit and deposit concentration risks are necessary, as indicated by \nthe high concentration of loans and deposits. NBE intends to mitigate market risks by \nimplementing prudent measures and enhancing governance standards and \npractices. These measures will also address the discrepancy between the proportion \nof ﬁxed rate assets and variable rate deposits. \nThe Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector’s infrastructure is developing, but it requires further \nimprovements in structural, operational, and technical eﬃciencies. A more reﬁned \nand explicit standard for risk measurement in keeping with the rapidly evolving \nlandscape of digital ﬁnancial technologies is one of the key policy developments \nanticipated to address the operational and technological threats that currently exist. \n3\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis 2024 Financial Stability Report is the second such document produced by NBE \nin line with its mandate to maintain a healthy ﬁnancial system in the country. 2 The \nreport discusses trends in and risks to Ethiopia’s economy and ﬁnancial sector, \nfocusing on developments in the reporting year 2023-2024 – but it also addresses \nimportant issues that have occurred up to September 2024, and details how and to \nwhat extent the ﬁnancial sector has been resilient, and whether it is expected to \nremain so. It also outlines recent policy and legal developments, as well as trends in \nthe ﬁnancial system’s infrastructure that are expected to enhance the sector’s stability \nin the remainder of 2024 and 2025. \nThe report is based on oﬃcial data for Ethiopia’s ﬁscal year to the end of June 20243  \nand incorporates, where appropriate, IMF data released in October 2024.\nThe stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system is aﬀected by multiple factors, from global \nto domestic ones. These include real economy factors, the structure and operation of \nthe ﬁnancial sector and its sub-sectors, and the ﬁnancial system infrastructure. \nThe following primary report chapters address each of these three groups: \nChapter 2 addresses projected developments and those recorded in recent years, \nboth in the global and local Ethiopian economies, drawing conclusions on how these \ndevelopments constitute risks or stabilizing factors for the country’s ﬁnancial system; \nChapter 3 analyzes Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial sector and its sub-sectors, identifying \ninherent risks to systemic stability; and \nChapter 4 analyzes the ﬁnancial system’s infrastructure and related policy \ndevelopments, as well as ﬁnancial inclusion and consumer protection, and their links \nwith the stability of the country’s ﬁnancial system. Each major section ends with a \nsummary risk assessment of the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system.\nSee Article 4 of Proclamation No. 591/2008.\nEthiopia’s ﬁscal year starts on the 8th of July and ends on the 7th of July, but this report bases its analyses on \ndata up to the 30th of June of each year.\n2\n3\n5\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n2. \nECONOMIC \nAND \nFINANCIAL \nCONDITIONS\n\n2. ECONOMIC AND \n    FINANCIAL CONDITIONS\n2. ECONOMIC AND \n    FINANCIAL CONDITIONS\nThe IMF’s most recent projections, released in October 2024, estimate global growth \nto decline slightly from 3.3 percent in 2023 to 3.2 percent in 2024 and remain at that \nlatter rate in 2025. Economic activity has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic growth \npath. Advanced economies are anticipated to experience only slightly higher growth \nin 2024 and 2025, at 1.8 percent, compared to 1.7 percent in 2023. The United States \nshows stronger consumption and nonresidential investment while growth in the euro \narea improves due to better export performance, in particular of goods. Growth in \nemerging markets and developing economies is projected to decrease from 4.4 \npercent in 2023 to 4.2 percent in 2024 and remain at that level in 2025 owing to \npersistent weakness in the real estate sector and low consumer conﬁdence in China \n(Figure 1).\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, growth is expected to remain at 3.6 percent in 2024, the same \nas in 2023, and increase to 4.2 percent in 2025, as the adverse impacts of prior \nweather shocks abate, and supply constraints gradually ease. According to IMF \nprojections, Ethiopia’s growth of 6.1 percent in 2024 4 and 6.5 percent in 2025 is \nlower than in 2023 (7.2 percent), but it nonetheless still positions the country among \nthe 20 fastest-growing economies in the world (Figure 1).\n8\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n2.1.

In contrast, inﬂation \nforecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa remain in double-digit territory because of high \ninﬂation in some large economies, driven by the pass-through of currency \ndepreciation and administrative price adjustments.\nExcept for Rwanda, which recorded 14 percent inﬂation year-on-year in December \n2023, annual inﬂation in most East African countries apart from Ethiopia remained in \nsingle digits in 2023, despite the shock to commodity prices following the wars in \nUkraine and the Middle East, and other factors. Ethiopia’s inﬂation, which peaked in \n2022, is projected to decline further, from 30.2 percent in December 2023 to 21 \npercent and 15 percent by the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively (Figure 2).\nOn July 9th, 2024, NBE announced the launch of a new monetary policy framework. \nMost notably, the NBE’s mandate has been clearly deﬁned to prioritize price stability \nrelative to other goals. The framework contains the following four measures:\n \n• NBE is using its policy interest rate (known as the national bank rate or NBR)  \n \n   as the primary means of signaling its policy stance and inﬂuencing broader  \n9\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nEthiopia\nKenya\nRwanda\nTanzania\nUganda\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024*\n2025*\nSource: IMF; *Projections\nFigure 2: Annual inﬂation rate in East African Countries, 2020-2025, December (percent)\n2.1.2 Monetary Developments\n\n \n   monetary and credit conditions. NBE is setting its initial policy interest rate  \n \n   at 15 percent. \n \n•  NBE is conduct a monetary policy-related auction every two weeks. \n \n•  NBE has also introduced overnight lending and overnight deposit facilities  \n \n   for banks that might need to manage their liquidity positions over just a   \n \n   one-day time horizon.\nSetting a benchmark policy rate, the start of open market auctions, and the \nintroduction of overnight facilities for banks are important initiatives to help NBE fulﬁll \nthe vital responsibilities – most notably to ensure price stability – set for it in its own \nstrategic plan and NBE establishment proclamation.\nEthiopia's monetary policy reforms are helping to improve ﬁnancial stability in several \nways by curbing inﬂation, modernizing the ﬁnancial sector, developing ﬁnancial \nmarket infrastructures among others.\nTable 1: Policy (Benchmark) Interest Rates of Selected Countries, 2020-2024 (end of year) (percent)\n10\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nSource: Bank for International Settlements (2024); for Ethiopia – NBE\nInterest rate developments in 2024 mostly showed declining trends, reﬂecting \nreduced inﬂation and continued attempts to stimulate economic growth. For example, \nthe European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve cut policy rates from 4.5 \npercent and 5.375 percent in December 2023 to 3.5 percent and 4.875 percent in \nSeptember 2024, respectively, with most of the cuts coming afer June 2024 (Table 1). \nMost emerging economies also cut rates. Among the fewer countries increasing policy \nrates are Russia and Türkiye, while India held its policy rate constant. Russia’s central \nbank raised its benchmark interest rate from 16 percent to 19 percent as the \ngovernment’s military spending strains the economy. Türkiye’s rate increased from \n42.5 percent in December 2023 to 50.0 percent in September 2024 as the Central \nBank of Türkiye aims to tackle inﬂation. In Ethiopia, NBE has set its initial policy interest \nrate at 15 percent on July 9, 2024, due to the introduction of the new monetary policy \nframework on July 9th, 2024, to align its policy tools with global best practices.\n2020  \n2021  \n2022  \n2023  \n2024 (Jun)  \n2024 (Sep)\n \nDeveloped \neconomies  \nEuro area \n0 \n0 \n2.5 \n4.5 \n4.25 \n3.5 \nUnited States \n0.125 \n0.125 \n4.375 \n5.375 \n5.375 \n4.875 \nOriginal \nBRICS  \nBrazil \n2 \n9.25 \n13.75 \n11.75 \n10.5 \n10.75 \nChina \n3.85 \n3.8 \n3.65 \n3.45 \n3.45 \n3.35 \nIndia \n4 \n4 \n6.25 \n6.5 \n6.5 \n6.5 \nRussia \n4.25 \n8.5 \n7.5 \n16 \n16 \n19 \nSouth Africa \n3.5 \n3.75 \n7 \n8.25 \n8.25 \n8 \nOther \ndeveloping \neconomies  \nMorocco \n1.5 \n1.5 \n2.5 \n3 \n2.75 \n2.75 \nSaudi Arabia \n1 \n1 \n5 \n6 \n6 \n5.5 \nTürkiye \n17 \n14 \n9 \n42.5 \n50 \n50 \nEthiopia \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n\nDomestic factors impact on the health of the Ethiopian ﬁnancial system much more \ndirectly and signiﬁcantly than global conditions. According to NBE’s analysis, certain \nfactors raise risks while others support stability and resilience. \n2.2.1. Economic Growth\nOver the last ﬁve years, Ethiopia's economy has registered high growth, which is \nprojected to continue in the coming years. Real GDP grew at above 6 percent each \nyear, higher than the average growth for Sub-Saharan Africa (which is projected at \n3.6 percent in 2024 by IMF). Real GDP has grown by 8.1 percent in the year to the \nend of June 2024 and is anticipated to grow by 8.4 percent in 2024-25, driven \nequally by services, agriculture, and industry from the supply side, and by personal \nspending and investment from the demand side (Figure 3).\nThe composition of GDP continued to change gradually. The share of services in \nGDP in 2024 decreased slightly for the ﬁrst time in years to 40.2 percent, from 40.3 \npercent in 2023, but it still surpasses the level of 39.5 percent recorded in 2020, \nwhich contracted as a result of COVID-19. The share of industry increased slightly – \nfor the ﬁrst time since 2021 – from 28.8 percent in 2023 to 29.1 percent in 2024. \nThe share of agriculture declined steadily from 32.7 percent in 2020 to 31.8 percent \nin 2024.\n11\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n2.2 DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 5\n2.2 DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 5\n5   Data for domestic economic conditions are all based on Ethiopian ﬁscal year which ended in June.\nOverall, Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial institutions, and the ﬁnancial system at large, face a \nvariety of risks due to reduced global economic growth and multiple \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical shocks. These have contributed to double-digit \ninﬂation at home and aﬀected the Ethiopian economy’s external position by driving \nup import costs and stiﬂing domestic economic activity and exports, thereby raising \nrisks for ﬁnancial institutions in the country. Developments in the various foreign \nexchange markets and policy interest rates continue to constitute risks that ﬁnancial \ninstitutions face in Ethiopia, although the risk level has been reduced as a result of the \nexchange rate reform undertaken in July 2024.\nPositively, though, global growth has proven remarkably resilient in the face of \nrecurring shocks, rising geopolitical tensions, and violent conﬂicts. \n2.1.3 Conclusion: Eﬀects for Financial System Stability in Ethiopia\n\nSource: Ministry of Planning and Development\nFigure 3: Ethiopia’s GDP by Sector and Economic Growth, 2020-2025 (percent)\n2.2.2 Inﬂation, Interest Rate, and Yields\nOver the last ﬁve years inﬂation has remained high. However, notwithstanding a \nnumber of unfavorable factors, such as inﬂation expectations, shortage of foreign \ncurrency, instability in parts of the country, and the rise in commodity prices, \nyear-on-year inﬂation fell from 29.3 percent in June 2023 to 19.9 percent as of June \n2024 (Figure 4). Inﬂation continued to fall even afer the adoption of a \nmarket-determined exchange rate in July 2024, reaching 17.5 percent at the end of \nSeptember 2024. In addition to the time lags involved to allow for the exchange rate \neﬀects to pass through to domestic prices, a large share of consumer prices followed \nthe parallel market exchange rate and limited percent of imports in private \nconsumption spending occurred at the oﬃcial exchange rate. Following the \nexchange rate reform, and taking into account anticipated pass-through eﬀects, the \nIMF projects annual inﬂation will be around 24 percent in June 2025 and then fall to \n12 percent in June 2026. \nThe domestic interest rate has remained stable and the yield on treasury bills has \nslightly increased. Commercial banks’ average long-term lending interest rates have \nbeen around 17 percent over the last four years (Figure 4). This has remained stable \neven afer the monetary and exchange rate reforms. However, the yearly weighted \naverage yield on government treasury bills was 9.74 percent in 2024, slightly up \nfrom 9.7 percent in 2023 and more than double the 4.54 percent recorded in 2020. \nThe yield has increased to 10.65 percent in the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year 2024-25, \nwhich ended in September 2024. Both the long-term lending rate and yield have \nremained below inﬂation. \n12\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025*\nAgriculture \nshare of GDP\nIndustry\nshare of GDP\nService\nshare of GDP\nReal GDP Growth\n31.8\n32.7\n32.5\n32.4\n32.1\n29.1\n29.0\n29.3\n28.9\n28.8\n40.2\n39.5\n39.6\n40.0\n40.3\n10.0\n9.0\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0%\n50%\n100%\n6.1\n6.3\n6.4\n7.2\n8.1\n8.4\n\n13\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nPERCENT\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025 Q1*\n0%\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n \n21.6\n17.0\n16.9\n17.0\n16.9\n16.5\n24.6\n34.0\n29.3\n19.9\n17.5\n4.54\n7.97\n9.46\n9.70\n9.74\n10.65\nAverage T-bills rate\nAverage Long Term lending rate \nHeadline Inﬂation (%)\nWhile the current account deﬁcit has been declining — relative to GDP — over the \npast few years, there was a widening gap (of nearly 100 percent as of June 2024) that \nemerged between the oﬃcial and parallel market exchange rates. To address this \nmajor distortion that was segmenting the foreign exchange market and substantially \nreducing foreign currency ﬂows into the banking system, an extensive reform of \nEthiopia’s foreign exchange regime was initiated on July 29th, 2024. This reform \naimed to fundamentally address Ethiopia’s balance of payments vulnerabilities in a \ncomprehensive and sustainable manner (see Box 2), and it has since allowed the oﬃcial \nexchange rate to move steadily towards a market-determined exchange rate. \nOn July 29th, 2024, NBE issued the Foreign Exchange Directive (FXD/01/2024) with \nimmediate eﬀect. Besides the move to a market-based determination of the exchange, \nthis new directive included many other far-reaching measures, including:\n \n•  Removal of foreign exchange surrender requirements to NBE.\n \n•  Removal of more than 30 import restrictions.\n \n•  Improved foreign exchange account retention rules for exporters.\n \n•  Opening the sector to independent foreign exchange bureaus.\n \n•  Allowing foreign exchange accounts for qualifying residents and \n \n    simpliﬁcation of foreign exchange account rules.\n \n•  Allowing Ethiopian companies and banks easier access to foreign loans.\n \n•  Enabling foreign participation in the upcoming Ethiopian \n \n    Securities Exchange.\nFigure 4: Inﬂation, Interest Rates and Yields, 2020-2025 (percent)\nBox 2: \nEthiopia’s 2024 Reform of the Foreign Exchange Regime \nSource: NBE and *Projections by the IMF Current Account Balance and Exchange Rate\n\n \n• Granting special foreign exchange privileges to companies operating in   \n \n   special economic zones.\nBy adopting a comprehensive approach, the foreign exchange reform is expected to \naddress acute foreign exchange shortages, enhance export competitiveness, attract \nforeign direct investment, and complement multiple other macroeconomic reforms \nbeing put in place to enhance conditions for private sector enterprises to grow and \nthrive in the Ethiopian economy. \nAlthough a full-scale assessment of the foreign exchange regime’s reform would still \nbe premature, the early results are positive and encouraging. The bank and parallel \nmarket exchange rates have largely converged (with the gap at or below 5 percent), \nallowing for a signiﬁcant shif of trading and foreign exchange activity towards the \nformal banking sector. Exports for the ﬁrst quarter are up 81 percent year-on-year \nwhile private remittances are up by 26 percent over the same period. Foreign \nexchange transaction volumes have risen steadily in the three months since the \nforeign exchange reform was introduced, with banks now making— on average \n—around US$500 million in monthly foreign exchange purchases and US$713 \nmillion in monthly foreign exchange sales from/to their customers. Foreign exchange \nreserve levels at the central bank have risen by more than 240% at the end of \nOctober 2024 as compared to June 2024 levels, while foreign exchange reserves at \ncommercial banks are also up substantially and stood at US$2.4 billion as of the end \nof October 2024. Higher foreign exchange reserves have allowed banks to \nsigniﬁcantly reduce their net foreign exchange obligations (net short positions) and \nmake increasingly greater allocations to business and consumers over the past few \nmonths. Reﬂecting these developments, and particularly a shrinking trade deﬁcit, the \nbalance of payments is showing systemic improvement, with the current account \nbalance in the ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁscal year (July-September 2024) turning into a \nsurplus of US$573 million compared to a deﬁcit of US$1.258 billion in the same \nperiod last year.\n39.0\n48.6\n53.3\n57.3\n117.5\n31.3\nOﬃcial Exchange Rate ( ETB / US$)\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n6.30.2024\n10.23.2024\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nFigure 5: Exchange Rate, 2020-2025 (percent of GDP, ETB/US$)\nSource: NBE and *Projections by the IMF World Economic Outlook: October 2024 Edition\n14\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n2.2.4 Conclusion: Eﬀects for Financial System Stability in Ethiopia\nOverall, with major ﬁscal, monetary, and exchange rate reforms put in place in recent \nmonths, there is a broadly positive macroeconomic outlook for 2024-25. Moreover, the \nadopted macroeconomic stabilization measures have been put in place in a manner \nthat minimizes adverse eﬀects thanks to the inclusion of extensive mitigating measures \n(especially subsidies for fuel, fertilizers, edible oil and medicine as well as higher \nallocations for civil service salaries and safety net beneﬁts). The banking system should \nalso beneﬁt from growth momentum, given expectations of record crop output, a jump \nin government social and capital spending, rising mining developments, and continued \nexpansion in private sector services and tourism.  While the macro-outlook is thus \ngenerally favorable for the year ahead, some potential risks to the Ethiopian ﬁnancial \nsector may arise from the impact of tightening monetary policies, from domestic \nsecurity risks, and from external factors such as commodity price volatility or shocks to \nglobal trade movements. Finally, the recently introduced NBE directives, which are \nintended to strengthen the ﬁnancial sector’s long-term viability, may impact ﬁnancial \npositions reported by banks in the short term, to the extent the new standards are \nsigniﬁcantly diﬀerent from the past practices of banks.  \n2.2.3 Fiscal Operations and Public Debt \nBoth public debt and the budget deﬁcit decreased in 2024 (Figure 6). Public external \ndebt signiﬁcantly reduced from 17.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 13.7 percent in 2024 \nwhile public domestic debt decreased from 22.1 percent of GDP in 2023 to 18.7 \npercent in 2024. The IMF projects external debt to reach 28.3 percent of GDP in \n2025, in response to the depreciation of the birr, and domestic debt to decline to 14.5 \npercent of GDP, assuming that ﬁscal ﬁnancing through direct advances by NBE has \nbeen eliminated. Likewise, the budget deﬁcit decreased from 2.5 percent of GDP in \n2023 to 2.1 percent in 2024, as a result of signiﬁcant improvements in revenue \ngrowth, the implementation of the ﬁscal consolidation strategy, and the resumption of \nthe inﬂux of donor funds. The IMF also predicts the budget deﬁcit to further decrease \nto 1.7 percent of GDP in 2025.\nFigure 6: Public Debt and Budget Balance, 2020-2025\nSource: Ministry of Finance and *Projections by the IMF Country Report: July 2024 and African Economic Outlook, 2024\nPERCENT\nBudget balance (% of GDP)\n0\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n-2.5\n-3\n3.5\n-4\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2024\n2025*\n2023\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2024\n2025*\n2023\nDomestic debt stock to GDP ratio\n26.8\n26.5\n22.1\n17.2\n13.7\n28.3\n-2.5\n-2.8\n-3.4\n-2.5\n-2.5\n-2.1\n24.4\n27.1\n24.8\n22.1\n18.7\n14.5\n15\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nExternal debt stock to GDP ratio\n\n3. \nFINANCIAL \nSECTOR STABILITY \nAND RISK\n\n3.1 OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR\nTable 2: Total Assets of the Financial System and the GDP, 2023-2024 (billions of birr and percent)\nSource: NBE Database\n3. FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY \n    AND RISK\n3. FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY \n    AND RISK\nThis chapter analyzes 6 stability and risks in the Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector across the \nbanking, microﬁnance and capital goods ﬁnancing, and insurance sectors, which are \nall regulated and supervised by NBE.  Policy actions taken by the government and the \nregulator remain supportive to the sector’s resilience and ﬁnancial stability.7\nEthiopia’s primary and secondary ﬁnancial markets are still in the early stages of \ndevelopment: the Capital Market Authority was established in June 2021, and the \nEthiopian Securities Exchange is currently ﬁnalizing preparations to launch before the \nend of 2024.\nAt the end of June 2024, total assets of the ﬁnancial sector amounted to just over \n3,409 billion birr, 15.1 percent higher than a year earlier (Table 2). These assets \nconstituted 29.5 percent of nominal GDP, compared with 37.6 percent at the end of \nJune 2023. The banking sector continued to dominate the ﬁnancial sector, with its \ntotal assets accounting for 96.1 percent of total ﬁnancial sector assets at the end of \nJune 2024 (similar to a year before). This implies that the stability of the Ethiopian \nﬁnancial system largely depends on the health and stability of the banking sector. As \na result, the banking sector is analyzed in more detail in the following sections.\n6 All ﬁnancial data used in this chapter is provisional (not audited).\n7 The report does not provide a detailed analysis of savings and credit cooperatives and pension funds.\n18\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nSector/Assets/GDP \nJune \n2023 \nShare in \ntotal \nassets (%) \nJune \n2024 \nShare in \ntotal \nassets (%) \nJune \n2024 vs. \nJune \n2023 (%) \nBanks  \n2,845.9 \n96.1 \n3,277.3 \n96.1 \n15.2 \nCommercial banks \n2,689.1 \n90.8 \n3,095.1 \n90.8 \n15.1 \nDevelopment bank \n156.8 \n5.3 \n182.2 \n5.3 \n16.2 \nMicroﬁnance \n61.7 \n2.1 \n60.1 \n1.8 \n-2.6 \nCapital goods ﬁnance \n5.4 \n0.2 \n6.4 \n0.2 \n18.5 \nInsurance \n49.7 \n1.7 \n65.6 \n1.9 \n32.0 \nTotal ﬁnancial system assets \n2,962.7 \n100 \n3,409.4 \n100 \n15.1 \nNominal GDP \n 8,722.0 \n  \n11,574.7 \n  \n46.9 \nTotal assets (%) of GDP \n37.6 \n  \n29.5 \n  \n-8.1 \n \n\n8   Of which one is full-ﬂedged interest-free bank, thus also included among the four interest free banks.\n3.2 BANKING SECTOR\n3.2.1   Commercial Banking Industry\n3.2.1.1   Role in the Economy\nBy the end of June 2024, 32 banks (all of them domestic) operated in Ethiopia. Of \nthese, the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), a development ﬁnance institution, \naccounted for nearly 5 percent of the banking sector’s assets. The other institutions \nare made up of four fully-ﬂedged interest-free banks, six former microﬁnance \ninstitutions (MFIs) that graduated to commercial banks8, and 22 conventional \ncommercial banks, including the country’s largest bank, the Commercial Bank of \nEthiopia (CBE). Except for the DBE and CBE, all are private banks. As the following \nsections show, the banking sector is assessed as safe, sound, and stable as of the end \nof June 2024.\nThe banking sector is very important to the Ethiopian economy. Total deposits at the \nend of June 2024 reached nearly 2.5 trillion birr, and total loans and bonds of banks \namounted to just under 2.2 trillion birr (Table 3). Both deposits and loans increased in \nthe year to June 2024, albeit at lower rates than a year earlier: Total bank deposits \ngrew by 15.4 percent, driven in particular by growth in demand for time deposits, \ncompared to 24.6 percent in the year to June 2023. Similarly, loans and bonds grew \nby 16.1 percent to June 2024, down from the 24.3 percent annual growth rate \nrecorded to June 2023. \nGDP increased at a faster rate than deposits and loans in the reporting period. As a \nresult, the share of deposits in GDP decreased to 21.6 percent from 24.8 percent at \nthe end of June 2023, and that of loans and bonds from 21.7 percent to 19.0 percent. \nThe share of loans in GDP is low by international comparison, and the objective is to \nincrease it signiﬁcantly in the medium term, thereby also reducing credit \nconcentration risk (see Section 3.2.1.3 below). A related positive development in this \nregard is the shif in the loan portfolio. Since 2021, total outstanding loans to the \nprivate sector have exceeded loans to the public sector.\nTotal assets of commercial banks reached 3.3 trillion birr at the end of June 2024 – \nan increase of 15.2 percent from the previous year; the growth rate is less than the \n19.9 percent recorded in June 2023. The major contributors to total assets growth \nwere loans and advances, and bonds, which together accounted for the largest share \n(66.9 percent) of total assets. \n19\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\nSource: NBE Database & Monetary and Financial Analysis Directorate of NBE\nIn line with international trends, Ethiopia established a deposit insurance scheme in \n2021. By reducing the likelihood of a “run” on the banks and microﬁnance institutions, \nthis is expected to contribute signiﬁcantly to stability in the banking and microﬁnance \nsectors and, hence, to the overall ﬁnancial system. Beyond the traditional banking and \nMFI sub-sectors, Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial sector is set to be transformed in its size and \nscope with the imminent launch of the ﬁrst organized securities exchange, the \nEthiopian Securities Exchange (See Box 3).\nTable 3: Banks' Major Balance Sheet Items (billion Birr)\nBox 3: \nCapital Market Developments and the Launch of the \nEthiopian Securities Exchange (ESX)\nThe development of the capital market’s ecosystem has recorded signiﬁcant strides since \n2019 when NBE began spearheading it through various foundational initiatives. NBE \nplayed the primary role in introducing the Ethiopian Capital Market Proclamation \n1248/202, and established a dedicated project team that was tasked with laying down the \nbasis to create the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and the Central Securities \nDepository (CSD). The government, through Ethiopian Investment Holdings, also \nchampioned the establishment of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX), which is \nexpected to be formally launched soon.\nThe capital market’s establishment plays an indispensable role in achieving development \ngoals by providing the public and private sectors with access to long-term ﬁnancing. Its \npresence enhances ﬁnancial avenues and introduces innovative instruments that improve \naccess to ﬁnance and promote savings and investment. For the private sector, these \nmarkets oﬀer risk-based, patient, long-term capital, fostering growth and development. \nThis process also signiﬁcantly elevates the standards of ﬁnancial reporting, corporate \ngovernance, and disclosure practices, enhancing the overall ﬁnancial and accounting \ncapacity of the nation. Equally important is the role of the capital market in bolstering \n20\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nParticulars \nJune \n2020 \nJune \n2021\n \nGrowth \n(%) \nJune \n2022 \nGrowth \n(%) \nJune \n2023 \nGrowth \n(%) \nJune \n2024 \nGrowth \n(%) \nTotal Assets (net)  \n1,462.4 \n1,843.2 \n26.0 \n2,374.1 \n28.8 \n2,845.9 \n19.9 \n3,277.3 \n15.2 \nLoans & Bonds  \n1,085.8 \n1,317.3 \n21.3 \n1,521.1 \n15.5 \n1,890.3 \n24.3 \n2,194.0 \n16.1 \n   Loans and Advances (net) \n559.0 \n766.9 \n37.2 \n986.7 \n28.7 \n1,247.5 \n26.4 \n1,440.9 \n15.5 \n   Bonds  \n526.8 \n550.4 \n4.5 \n534.4 \n-2.9 \n642.8 \n20.3 \n693.1 \n7.8 \nTotal Deposits \n1,041.9 \n1,360.1 \n30.5 \n1,735.3 \n27.6 \n2,162.2 \n24.6 \n2,494.7 \n15.4 \n   Saving deposits \n622.5 \n855.8 \n37.5 \n1,085.3 \n26.8 \n1,370.1 \n26.2 \n1,524.3 \n11.3 \n   Demand deposits \n356.4 \n439.6 \n23.3 \n567.1 \n29.0 \n679.9 \n19.9 \n813.2 \n19.6 \n   Time deposits \n63.1 \n64.7 \n2.5 \n83.0 \n28.3 \n112.2 \n35.2 \n157.1 \n40.0 \nRegulatory Capital \n105.2 \n121.9 \n15.9 \n168.9 \n38.5 \n212.4 \n25.7 \n258.3 \n21.6 \nGDP \n3,374.7 \n4,341.0 \n28.6 \n6,157.0 \n41.8 \n7,881.6 \n41.7 \n11,574.7 \n10.7 \nShares (%) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoans in GDP \n16.6 \n17.7 \n  \n16.0 \n  \n14.3 \n  \n12.4 \n  \nDeposits in GDP \n30.9 \n31.3 \n  \n28.2 \n  \n24.8 \n  \n21.6 \n  \nLoans & Bonds in GDP \n32.2 \n30.3 \n  \n24.7 \n  \n21.7 \n  \n19.0 \n  \nLoans & Bonds in Total Assets \n74.2 \n71.5 \n  \n64.1 \n  \n66.4 \n  \n66.9 \n  \nLoans & Bonds to Total Deposits \n104.2 \n96.9 \n \n87.7 \n \n87.4 \n \n87.9 \n \n\n3.2.1.2   Industry Structure and Systemic Risk\nOf the 31 commercial banks registered by the end of June 2024 in Ethiopia, one is a \nstate-owned bank; four are private interest-free banks; 9 six are MFIs transformed into \ncommercial banks; and the rest are conventional private commercial banks.\nBased on asset size, NBE distinguishes three types of commercial banks: large, \nmedium, and small banks. Their respective roles in, and share of, the market (Table 4) \nare as follows:\n9 One of these is majority-owned by a regional government.\n21\ndomestic ﬁnancing for the public sector. Access to debt ﬁnancing via bonds issued on the \ndomestic capital market gives the government of Ethiopia eﬃcient avenues for raising \ndomestic ﬁnancing, which complements NBE’s monetary policy reforms.\nThe Ethiopian Capital Market Authority has, to date, played an active role in laying down \nthe relevant legal and regulatory framework to establish a safe, transparent, and eﬃcient \ncapital market. The introduction of directives regulating the manner with which securities \nare issued and traded, the licensing of capital market service providers, securities \nexchanges, and over-the-counter platforms, play a critical role in introducing order, \ntransparency, and eﬃciency in the operation of the nation’s capital market.  \nMost importantly, the imminent launch of the ESX marks a pivotal milestone in the \nEthiopian capital market ecosystem’s development. As the ﬁrst organized securities \nexchange in the nation, established through a partnership between the public and private \nsectors, ESX is poised to play a crucial role in advancing the government’s economic \nreform agenda. Its formation signiﬁes a transformative step towards enhancing the \nresilience and inclusivity of the ﬁnancial sector, positioning Ethiopia on a new trajectory of \nﬁnancial modernization and integration. \nESX will be a fully electronic and modern market from its launch. The exchange’s modern \nAutomated Trading System, which is integrated with NBE’s CSD, will transform the \nhitherto manual securities trading environment into a high-speed, eﬃcient electronic \nmarketplace. The introduction of modern broker-back oﬃce and order management \nsystems that include mobile trading applications will allow Ethiopians across the country \nto directly participate in the market, there by democratizing the capital market ecosystem.\nThe multifaceted signiﬁcance of the ESX for the ﬁnancial sector is evidenced by the fact \nthat, ahead of its launch, the exchange is currently serving as the market infrastructure \nand technology platform for the interbank money market – which was launched by NBE \nand commercial banks in November 2024. The introduction of this electronic interbank \nmoney market is expected to play a pivotal role in enhancing the transparency, reliability \nand eﬃciency of the money market, thereby boosting the ﬁnancial sector’s overall \nliquidity. With the launch of a money market through an online platform administered by \nESX, banks can now lend to and borrow from each other on a modern electronic \nplatform. Within the ﬁrst three weeks of its operation the market transacted more than 20 \nbillion birr, signifying its immense potential.\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\nSource: NBE Database and Oﬀ-site Reports\nTable 4: Banking Industry Market Shares, June 2024 versus June 2023 (percent)\nLarge Bank: The only large bank in the country is the state-owned CBE. Although its \nmarket share declined from the previous year, CBE still remains a systemically \nimportant bank. At the end of June 2024, its total assets and deposits constituted just \nunder half (47.9 percent and 47.1 percent, respectively) of the whole banking sector. \nHowever, its total capital accounted for just less than a quarter (24.2 percent) of the \ntotal. \nMedium Banks: The combined share of the ﬁve medium-sized banks 10 in the industry \nincreased for all key balance sheet items in the year to the end of June 2024 \ncompared to a year earlier: combined assets went from 28.0 percent to 28.9 percent \nof the sector’s total assets, total deposits from 29.4 percent to 30.3 percent of the \nsector’s total, and capital from 31.0 percent to 33.0 percent. Nevertheless, no \nmedium-sized bank is currently regarded as a systemically important bank, despite \nthe growing market share.\nSmall Banks: At the end of June 2024, the combined assets and deposits of the 25 \nsmall banks 11 accounted for 23.3 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively, of the whole \nbanking sector – an annual increase of 0.8 percentage points each. Likewise, their \ncombined total capital share increased from 41.6 percent of the sector’s total capital \nin 2023 to 42.8 percent at the end of June 2024. The growth of the small banks’ \naggregate market share can be explained by their increasing number over the years \nand the rapid initial expansion of the newly established banks. However, with an \nindividual share in assets, deposits, and loans, and bonds of less than two percent, \nnone of the small banks can be considered a systemically important bank.\n10   Awash Bank, Bank of Abyssinia, Cooperative Bank of Oromia, Dashen Bank, Hibret Bank.\n11   Abay Bank, Addis International Bank, Ahadu Bank, Amhara Bank, Berhan Bank, Bunna Bank, Enat Bank, Gadaa  \n     Bank, Global Bank, Goh Betoch Bank, Hijra Bank, Lion International Bank, Nib International Bank, Omo Bank,     \n    Oromia Bank, Rammis Bank, Shabelle Bank, Sidama Bank, Siinqee Bank, Siket Bank, Tsedey Bank, Tsehay Bank,  \n    Wegagen Bank, ZamZam Bank, Zemen Bank.\n22\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n \nTotal Assets \nTotal Loans & \nBonds \nTotal Deposits \nTotal Capital \nType of \nbank \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nBy size \nclass \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLarge \n49.5 \n47.9 \n46.7 \n45.2 \n48.7 \n47.1 \n27.5 \n24.2 \nMedium \n28.0 \n28.9 \n30.5 \n31.1 \n29.4 \n30.3 \n31.0 \n33.0 \nSmall \n22.5 \n23.3 \n22.9 \n23.7 \n21.9 \n22.7 \n41.6 \n42.8 \nBy \nownership \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n49.5 \n47.8 \n46.7 \n45.2 \n48.7 \n47.1 \n27.5 \n24.2 \nPrivate \n50.5 \n52.2 \n53.4 \n54.8 \n51.3 \n52.9 \n72.6 \n75.8 \n \n\nAssessment of Systemic Risk Stemming from Industry Structure\nAs indicated above, CBE is a systemic bank in the Ethiopian banking system and can \ntherefore entail systemic risk. The CBE has withstood a number of recent negative \ndomestic and external shocks, including local conﬂicts and droughts/landslides, \nglobal inﬂation, disruptions to the supply chain brought on by the war in Ukraine and \nthe Middle East, changes in the price of oil and other commodities, climate change \nand other impactful developments.\nThe CBE has a high cushion of regulatory capacity as its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) \nis signiﬁcantly above NBE’s 8 percent minimum capital requirement, and its liquidity \nposition is also high, above the 15 percent minimum requirement. While CBE’s CAR \nremains above the regulatory minima at all levels of risk stress, its liquidity position \ncould fall below the regulatory minimum in the (unlikely) event of a sudden withdrawal \nby its 10 most important depositors (see Section 3.2.1.5).\nMoreover, because the majority of the bank’s paid-up capital is a government-issued \npromissory bond (Proclamation No. 994/2017 Government Bond) that has not yet \nbeen fully paid for in cash, CBE’s capital position requires targeted policy and \nregulatory attention in the event of unfavorable circumstances. CBE’s exposure to \ngovernment-guaranteed but nonperforming exposures to Liability and Asset \nManagement Company (LAMC) and Ethiopia Electric Power (EEP) are being replaced \nwith government bonds resulting in the removal of these items from CBE balance \nsheet and restructuring of its balance sheet accordingly. NBE will be following up the \nproper implementation of this in due course.\n23\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nBox 4: \nCommercial Bank of Ethiopia’s Resolution\nAccounting for around 50 percent of Ethiopia’s banking industry in terms of market share \nof its assets and deposit base, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), with its wide \ngeographical coverage and presence, is systemically important and the longest serving \nbank in the country. CBE has played a central role in Ethiopia’s economic growth and \ndevelopment since its establishment. However, its past overexposure to projects run by \npublic sector organizations has put the bank under stress.\nCognizant of the need to address its problems and ensure a sustainable business model \nthat best supports economic growth and development, the Ethiopian government \nembarked on a major reform program at CBE. To support its reform agenda, the \ngovernment is also working with the World Bank to eﬀectively implement and realize \nthese necessary changes under the auspices of a ﬁnancial sector strengthening project \n(FSSP).\n\n3.2.1.3 \nCredit Concentration\n24\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nA. \nCredit Concentration by Economic Sector\nAs with the year before, manufacturing accounted for Ethiopian banks’ largest share \nof loans and advances (23.0 percent) at the end of June 2024, followed by domestic \ntrade and services, with 20.1 percent (Table 5). However, both showed lower growth \nthan total banking loans. However, the largest changes in the composition of credit \nover the year were around the decline in credit to the export sector – a drop by 1.6 \npercentage points, and almost stagnation in terms of loan value – and the increases \nin loans to consumers (plus 1.3 percentage points) and the building and construction \nThe FSSP, which is spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of \nEthiopia (NBE), and ﬁnanced by the World Bank, is designed to a large extent to ensure \nthe successful restructuring, recapitalization and reform of CBE. The restructuring aims to \nreduce CBE’s exposure to nonperforming state-owned enterprise assets by transferring \nthe stock of loans owed by the Liability and Asset Management Company (LAMC) and \nEthiopian Electric Power (EEP) to the government. In addition, a subsequent recapitaliza-\ntion exercise aims to increase CBE’s capital in line with its systemic importance in the \nsector. Accordingly, the House of People’s Representatives approved a government-pro-\nposed bill to issue bonds worth 900 billion birr to CBE. This was to ensure the assumption \nof these state enterprises’ debts by the government and the injection of additional capital \nto CBE. The transfer of the debts from LAMC and EEP to the government does not \nchange the public sector’s total exposure to debt, as this is not a new obligation. Instead, \nit makes the debt the government’s responsibility rather than the two public enterprises’.  \nTo support the implementation of this reform program, the World Bank is expected to \napprove concessional ﬁnancing worth US$700 million to further strengthen the banking \nsector’s supervision framework and its regulations. The funds will also support the recapi-\ntalization of CBE and the various reform activities that each of the implementing agencies \n(i.e., NBE, CBE and DBE) will undertake. Meanwhile, as part of the reform activities, CBE \nwill redeﬁne its governance and operating model in a way that ensures its commercial \nmandate, conduct its future operations in a prudent and sustainable manner, ensure com-\npliance with applicable NBE regulations (including on corporate governance and risk \nmanagement), implement recommendations of an asset quality review, and pursue \nvarious cost optimization measures.  \nIn short, the implementation of the CBE reforms is expected to ensure the bank’s \nimproved ﬁnancial soundness and sustainability and further cement the contribution it \nmakes towards supporting private sector-led economic growth and development going \nforward.\nOverall, the risk stemming from the concentration of the industry’s structure has \ncontinued to gradually decline in the reporting year, as the market share of the one \nsystemically important bank further decreased.\n\nSource: NBE Database\nTable 5: Banking Loans by Sector (billion birr)\nsector \n(plus \n1.0 \npercentage \npoints), \nwhich \nindicates \na \nshif \ntowards \ndomestically-oriented economic activities and away from exports.\nOverall, as a result of the sectoral shifs, the concentration of the loan portfolio across \nsectors – which had already been relatively diversiﬁed in the year to June 2023 – \ndecreased further during the reporting period.\nB. \nCredit Concentration by Borrowers\nThe banking sector’s loans and advances are relatively concentrated due to the past \npractice of large-scale lending to major state enterprises and regional governments.\nIf including such large state-owned enterprises, the top 10 borrowers in the banking \nindustry held 14.7 percent of its total loans and advances at the end of June 2024, a \nsigniﬁcantly lower share than a year earlier (23.5 percent). However, excluding \nstate-owned enterprises, concentration ratios are much lower, with the top 10 private \nborrowers making up 3.5 percent of bank loans and advances.  Large borrowers, \ndeﬁned as those with credit exposure of above 10 million birr, constituted only 0.5 \npercent of the total, but they held almost three quarters (74.8 percent) of the entire \nbanking sector loans. This is a higher share than the year before. A signiﬁcant number \nof loans at the end of June 2024 was held by borrowers from urban areas.12 \nLooking ahead, as banks work to comply with the credit granting conditions in the \nrevised NBE directives, it is expected that credit concentration risk in the banking \nsector will be gradually reduced. The relevant regulatory changes in this respect \ninclude accurate mapping of connected borrowers and compliance with the \ncorresponding quantitative prudential limits stipulated in the Large Exposures \nDirective. In addition, the changes involve the application of revised criteria to identify \nrelated parties and their compliance with the corresponding quantitative prudential \nlimits as stipulated in the Related Party Transaction Directive (for more detail, see \nSection 3.2.3 below). \n25\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nSector\n \nJune 2023 \nJune 2024 \n2024 vs. 2023 \nAmount \n(billion birr) \nShare (%)  \nAmount \n(billion birr) \nShare (%)  \nChange in \nvalue (%) \nChange in  share \n( percentage points ) \nAgriculture \n83.7 \n6.4 \n95.1 \n6.3 \n13.6 \n-0.1 \nBuilding & Construction \n132.3 \n10.1 \n167.0 \n11.1 \n26.2 \n1.0 \nManufacturing \n304.6 \n23.2 \n345.3 \n23.0 \n13.4 \n-0.2 \nImport \n99.3 \n7.6 \n122.1 \n8.1 \n23.0 \n0.5 \nExport \n205.4 \n15.7 \n212.1 \n14.1 \n3.3 \n-1.6 \nDomestic Trade & Services\n \n270.9 \n20.7 \n302.1 \n20.1 \n11.5 \n-0.6 \nStaﬀ & Consumers \n138.2 \n10.5 \n176.8 \n11.8 \n27.9 \n1.3 \nOther Business \n76.5 \n5.8 \n80.5 \n5.3 \n5.2 \n-0.5 \nTotal \n1,311.0 \n100.0 \n1,500.9 \n100 \n14.5 \n \n \n12   Urban areas are those settlements with a population of 20,000 and above or regional and zonal capitals.\n\n3.2.1.4 \nSoundness Indicators\nThe commercial banking industry in Ethiopia is considered sound and resilient based \non an assessment of these ﬁnancial soundness indicators – capital adequacy ratio, \nliquidity position, and non-performing loans (NPLs).\nA. Asset Quality Indicators\nAs a result of low NPLs and adequate provisioning for them, the quality of assets in \nthe Ethiopian commercial banking industry was generally sound at the end of June \n2024, despite indicators preforming slightly worse compared to a year earlier.\nThe ratio of NPLs to gross loans increased slightly in the year to the end of June \n2024 to 3.9 percent, from 3.6 percent for the same period in 2023 (Figure 7a), still \nsubstantially below the regulatory maximum of 5 percent. Nevertheless, in a few \nbanks NPLs rose above this minimum. As a result, NBE is working with them to \naddress the underlying challenges.\nFurthermore, provisioning decreased from 132.5 percent of NPLs at the end of June \n2023 to 104.1 percent at year later (Figure 7b), though still fully covering all reported \nNPLs. Given the reported level of NPLs, banks have provided adequate provisions to \ncover their impaired loans.\nIt should be noted that the revised directive on asset classiﬁcation and provisioning, \nissued by NBE in June 2024, will lead to improved and more prudent measures in \nterms of asset classiﬁcation and the maintenance of the required provisioning (see \nSection 3.2.3 below). This is expected to further improve the banking system’s \nclassiﬁcation and NPL reporting.\nFigure 7: Banks’ Non-Performing Loans to Gross Loans and Non-Performing Loans  \n \n \n \n \n Provisioning, 2020-2024 (percent)\na) NPLs ratio\nb) NPL provisioning\nSource: NBE Database\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2024\n2023\nNPLs Ratio\nRegulatory NPL Limit\nProvisions to NPLS Ratio\n0\n150\n100\n50\n \n2020\n2021\n2022\n2024\n2023\n3.0\n3.5\n3.9\n3.9\n3.6\n93.2\n70.0\n122.9\n132.5\n104.1\n26\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\nB.  Capital Adequacy Indicators\nThe regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets ratio for the banking sector slightly \nincreased from 14.7 percent at the end of June 2023 to 15.4 percent in June 2024, \ncomparing favorably with the regulatory minimum of 8 percent. Meanwhile, the \nleverage ratio (capital to total assets) continued its steady positive trend, increasing \nfrom 8.1 percent to 8.4 percent (Figure 8).\nFigure 8: Banking Industry Capital Adequacy Indicators, 2020-2024 (percent)\nCapital adequacy ratio\nCapital to total assets ratio \nSource: NBE Database \nC. Liquidity Indicators\nAlthough the liquid assets to deposits ratio of the banking sector decreased from \n24.2 percent at the end of June 2023 to 22.4 percent a year later, it still compared \nfavorably with the regulatory minimum of 15 percent (Figure 9).\nDuring the same period, the ratio of loans to deposits remained stable, dropping by \nonly 0.4 percentage points to 60.2 percent, while the ratio of loans and bonds to \ndeposits increased slightly to 87.9 percent, from 87.4 percent in the previous year \n(Table 3 above). These ratios are still very high, though, and suggest that nearly all \ndeposits are held up by borrowers, leaving limited room for large and unexpected \ndeposit withdrawals. Nevertheless, the high ratios result in relatively low liquid assets, \nwhich could lead to a liquidity problem under unfavorable circumstances.\nThe decrease in the liquidity ratio may have been caused by increased lending, \nparticularly to the building and construction, import, and households’ sectors (see \nTable 5 above). Although the increased lending is in line with the general policy to \nencourage lending to the economy’s key sectors, NBE continues to caution going \nabove a loan to deposit ratio of 85 percent to ensure the sector remains resilient to \nadverse liquidity shocks.\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n0%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n \nCAR\nThreshold\n18.4\n15.2\n15.2\n16.3\n14.7\n27\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nJune\n2020\nJune\n2021\nJune\n2022\nJune\n2023\nJune\n2024\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n7.3\n7.7\n8.4\n8.0\n8.1\n\nFigure 9: Banking Industry Liquidity Indicators (percent)\nSource: NBE Database \nA high concentration of deposits and the diﬀerence in maturities between deposits and \nloans may create a liquidity risk in the banking sector despite the existing \nabove-the-minimum liquidity ratio: At the end of June 2024, 58.5 percent of the total \nbanking sector deposits was held by only 0.4 percent of the sector’s depositors. \nHowever, similar to credit concentration, state-owned enterprises are among the largest \ndepositors, so the concentration of private sector deposits is considerably smaller. The \nliquid assets of banks only incorporated a small share of high-quality liquid assets (cash). \nAs a result, some banks were facing real-time transaction-level liquidity shortages. This \nis analyzed further as part of the liquidity risk stress test in Section 3.2.1.5.\nD. \nProﬁtability Indicators\nThe total income of the banking sector was 361.4 billion birr for the year to the end of \nJune 2024, up from 297.5 billion birr in the previous year (Figure 10).

Credit Risk Stress Test\nNBE performed a banking sector credit risk stress test at end of June 2024 for the 12 \nmonths ahead under baseline, moderate and severe scenarios. The scenarios were \ncalibrated according to domestic and international shocks that could negatively \nimpact the recovery and, eventually, the credit risk of the banking industry. 13\nThe baseline scenario (pre-shock) assumes that the NPL ratio will not change from \nthe current 3.9 percent level, anticipating that the economy will grow according to the \nIMF’s forecast, with international and domestic conditions improving, and the country \nfree of droughts and conﬂicts. The moderate scenario assumes that NPLs in the \nbanking industry will increase to 10.0 percent. In principle, this could happen as a \nresult of deteriorating domestic and/or external circumstances, such as drought and \nheightened conﬂict or increasing foreign currency shortages. The severe scenario \nassumes that NPLs will increase to 30.0 percent.\n21.6\nReturn on Equity\nReturn on Asset\n0\n35.0\n30.0\n25.0\n20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n26.7\n32.6\n25.7\n1.7\n1.9\n2.4\n2.0\n24.6\n2.0\n13  A preliminary assessment had established that capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio (regulatory CAR) of all \nbanks was higher than the 8.0 percent minimum statutory requirement. Thus, all banks were included in the stress \ntest.\n29\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nThe proﬁtability of the banking industry decreased slightly but is considered suﬃcient. \nReturn on equity and return on assets were 24.6 percent and 2.0 percent at the end of \nJune 2024 respectively, compared to 25.7 percent and 2.0 percent a year earlier \n(Figure 11). Return on equity was marginally lower than that of the previous year primarily \nbecause of an increase in bank provisioning.\n\nTable 6: Results of Credit Risk Stress Test (increase in non-performing loans)\nSource: Developed from NBE Database and Oﬀ-site Reports\nThe credit risk stress test results (Table 6) provide an assessment of banks’ capital \nerosion following assets quality impairment under the moderate and severe \nscenarios. The results indicate that all banks have suﬃcient capital to withstand a \nmoderate shock. Under the severe scenario, the aggregate CAR of the banking \nsector would still remain well above the regulatory minimum of 8.0 percent, at 12.3 \npercent. However, four banks would fail the stress test due to an increase in NPLs \nunder this scenario, requiring additional capital equal to 6.5 billion birr (4.8 percent \nof risk-weighted assets). This is a marked improvement compared to the situation a \nyear earlier, when 12 banks would have fallen below the regulatory minimum CAR. \nThe systemic bank – and the majority of MFIs that converted to banks, in the small \nbanks class – have more capital and would not require capital injections under the \nsevere scenario. Therefore, there is no systemic credit risk for the banking sector as a \nwhole, even under the severe scenario.\nB. Liquidity Risk Stress Test\nThe liquidity risk stress test considers the aggregate impact on the banking sector’s \nliquidity if the top 10 depositors in each bank suddenly withdraw all their money. This \nis an extreme scenario because, as mentioned in section 3.2.1.3, state-owned \nenterprises are among the largest depositors and would be highly unlikely to fully \nwithdraw deposits simultaneously.\nThe results of the stress test (Table 7) suggest that the Ethiopian commercial banking \nsector is highly sensitive to liquidity risk from sudden withdrawals by a few big \ndepositors. The banking industry had also become more sensitive by the end of June \n2024 than the previous year. Exposed to the same shock, 18 banks would have failed to \nmeet the minimum liquidity requirements of June 2023; this has now increased to 20. \n30\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n \nBaseline Scenario \n(Pre-shock)* \nModerate \nScenario \nSevere \nScenario \nAssumed level of NPL (%) \n3.9 \n10.0 \n30.0 \nImpact of NPL shock on CAR \n \n \n \nResulting Regulatory Capital Ratio (%) \n15.4 \n15.3 \n12.3 \nNumber of banks below minimum regulatory CAR \n- \n- \n4 \n *based on Data as of June 2024\n\nTable 7: Result of Liquidity Risk Stress Test (withdrawal of top 10 depositors)\nSource: Developed from NBE Database and Oﬀ-site Reports\nAt the same time, as already noted in Section 3.2.1.3, the revised NBE directives that \naim to reduce credit concentration in the banking sector will also gradually reduce \nliquidity risk. Measures to enhance accurate mapping of large borrowers and \ncompliance with the corresponding quantitative limits stipulated in the Large \nExposures Directive will reduce banks’ exposure to large depositors (see Section 3.2.3 \nbelow). So too will the application of revised criteria on the identiﬁcation of related \nparties and compliance with the corresponding quantitative limits as stipulated in the \nRelated Party Transaction Directive.\nC. \nForeign Exchange Stress Test\nFollowing the reform of the foreign exchange regime undertaken in late July 2024, \nthe value of the birr against the US dollar decreased by more than 100 percent, from \nabout 57 birr per dollar to about 117 birr per dollar. With few exceptions, the banking \nsystem weathered this shock well. As a further depreciation of the birr is possible \nunder adverse conditions, NBE undertook a foreign exchange rate stress test. This \nanalyses the eﬀects of a further increase in the exchange rate by 10 percent, 20 \npercent, and 30 percent. Considering the birr exchange rate has already adjusted \nfollowing the introduction of the foreign exchange regime reform, a further \ndepreciation during the year ahead under the latter two scenarios must be considered \nas unlikely.\nThe results of the stress test indicate the banking industry CAR will remain above the \nminimum regulatory requirement of 8.0 percent under all scenarios. Although one \nbank would fail to meet the minimum CAR requirement under the 30.0 percent \nincrease scenario (Table 8).\n31\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n \nStress Test Based on June 2023 \nData \nStress Test Based on June 2024 \nData \nBaseline \nScenario (Pre-\nShock) \nTop 10 \nDepositors \nWithdrawal \nScenario \nBaseline \nScenario (Pre-\nShock) \nTop 10 \nDepositors \nWithdrawal \nScenario \nSize of the Shock \nBr 524.7 billion \nliquid assets \nWithdrawal of Br \n288.8 billion \nBr 559.6 billion \nliquid assets \nWithdrawal of Br \n359.9 billion \nImpact of shock on \nliquidity \n \n \n \n \nResulting Regulatory \nLiquidity Ratio (%) \n24.0 \n13.0 \n22.4 \n9.4 \nNumber of Banks \nBelow minimum \nRegulatory Liquidity \nRatio  \n- \n18 \n- \n20 \n \n\nTable 8: Result of Foreign Exchange Stress Test, September 2024\nSource: Developed from NBE Database \n3.2.2  Development Finance Institution\nThe total assets 14 of the DBE grew by 15.5 percent from the previous year to 182.2 \nbillion birr at end of June 2024.

The directives are also meant to \naddress speciﬁc corporate governance and risk management weaknesses existing in \nsome banks. Such weaknesses involve poor objectivity and insuﬃcient competence \nat board level, including a lack of independent directors and the under-estimation of \ncredit risk concentration due to the poor identiﬁcation of connected borrowers. In \naddition, there is an under-estimation of insider lending due to the exclusion of \nrelationship through ownership: for example, the relationship between state-owned \nbanks and enterprises. Lastly, there is inadequate prudential provisioning for loan \nlosses, leading to the overstatement of proﬁts, due to the improper grading of \nexposures.\nTo ensure that operations of aﬀected banks are not disrupted in a bid to comply with \nthe revised directives, NBE has allowed transitional arrangements for each of the ﬁve \ndirectives as appropriate. \nOverall, the revised directives are expected to lead to a signiﬁcant improvement in the \nsafety and soundness of the banking sector and the banks’ intermediary role in the \neconomy, enhanced ﬁnancial stability, and ultimately provide a boost to economic \nprosperity in Ethiopia\n3.2.3.1 \nDirectives on Corporate Governance \nIn a bid to strengthen its supervisory framework, NBE revised directives on bank \ncorporate governance and requirements for persons with signiﬁcant inﬂuence in a \nbank.\n1. Bank Corporate Governance Directive. To enhance corporate objectivity, \naccountability and transparency, banks are now required to have independent \ndirectors. The process to nominate and elect directors has also been streamlined to \nmake it more eﬃcient. Lastly, in recognition of inclusion and diversity, a bank board \nof directors should have at least two women directors. \n2. Requirements for Persons with Signiﬁcant Inﬂuence in a Bank Directive. To \nensure the banking sector’s integrity as well as its stable and long-term institutional \nsuccess, NBE tightened the ﬁtness and propriety requirements for banks’ directors \nand management. The revised requirements include limiting the number of \ndirectorships; ensuring senior bankers make the necessary time commitment, are \nindependence of mind, and manage conﬂict of interest; and seeking higher \nqualiﬁcations and relevant experience for the chief executive oﬃcer of a bank and \ndirectors.\n\n34\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n3.2.3.3 Other banking business regulatory and supervisory reforms\nIn addition to monitoring the implementation of the above-mentioned ﬁve directives, \nNBE is currently working on other reforms aimed at strengthening its banking \nregulatory and supervision processes to align them with international best practice \nand ensure their continuous improvement. \nIn the review period, the banking sector remained stable and resilient against the \nbackdrop of strong domestic economic growth, eﬀective monetary and ﬁnancial \npolicies, but also conﬂicts and droughts in some parts of the country. Overall, the \noutlook for 2024/2025 is also positive. Underpinned by suﬃcient capital and \nproﬁtability, the sector will remain stable and resilient, which is also conﬁrmed by the \n3.2.3.2 \nDirectives on Credit Risk Management \nAs part of guidance to banks in the management of credit risk, concentration risk, and \nconﬂict of interest, NBE revised directives on large exposures, asset classiﬁcation and \nprovisioning; and related party transactions.\n1. \nLarge Exposures Directive. To reduce vulnerabilities due to concentrated \nlending, banks are required to observe limits when lending to an individual borrower \nor group of connected borrowers, as well as maintaining internal mechanisms to \nmonitor such concentration risk. In this directive, NBE clariﬁed the criteria for \nidentifying connected borrowers, and stipulated exempted categories of borrowers, \nto ensure that concentration risk is accurately determined.\n2. \nAsset Classiﬁcation and Provisioning Directive. To ensure that credit risk \narising from loans and other assets is accurately measured, and provided for in a \ntimely manner consistent with accepted international accounting principles and \nregulatory standards, NBE tightened the conditions for how banks grade loans and \ntreat and report restructured loans and NPLs. The directive also sets maximum limits \nfor loan iteration and the treatment of NPLs, including the maintenance of provisions \nfor oﬀ-balance sheet exposures.\n3. \nRelated Party Transactions Directive. Related parties are persons \nconnected with the bank either through control and/or employment. This directive \nlimits the sum of all exposures directly or indirectly held by a bank to any single related \nparty, and forbids a bank to conduct any transactions with a related party on \npreferential terms compared to conditions normally applied to unrelated parties.\n3.2.4 Summary Assessment of Risks for Financial System \n            Stability Emanating from the Banking Sector\n\nlatest banking sector risk stress test results. However, there are some downside risks \nassociated with potential domestic and external shocks.\nA. \nCredit Risk\nThe banking industry’s credit risk remained moderate during the review period \nbut is expected to increase in 2024/2025.  Credit risk could increase because of \nconﬂicts in some parts of the country. In addition, a deterioration in the external sector \n– the implication of the global monetary policy on domestic interest rates, the \nexchange rate and capital ﬂows; and the impact of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle \nEast on trade and other transactions – could also increase credit risk. This risk \nappears to be accentuated at face value by the high levels of credit concentration. \nHowever, it is lower in practice when the role of state-owned enterprises in the \nbanking system’s loan portfolio is considered. Also, NBE is closely monitoring this \nsituation through supervisory tools contained in the revised directives on large \nexposures and related party transactions, issued in June 2024. \nSince loans, advances, and bonds constitute the lion’s share of bank assets, credit risk \nremains one of the most important and inherent risks that banks need to eﬀectively \nmanage. Therefore, it is imperative to follow prudent, principle-based lending and \nﬁnancing practices that are in line with a bank’s risk strategy and appetite, as well as \napplicable legal requirements. In this regard, the asset quality of Ethiopia’s banking \nsystem as a whole and of most banks is deemed satisfactory as their NPL ratio is \nbelow NBE’s 5.0 percent maximum. However, in light of the aforementioned systemic \nrisks and the less than satisfactory performance of some banks, NBE is closely \nmonitoring ﬁnancial institutions with relatively higher NPLs to reduce this category so \nthey can maintain acceptable exposure to these loans and credit portfolios. NBE will \nalso closely monitor banks’ compliance with its recently issued directive on asset \nclassiﬁcation and provisioning to ensure, among other things, they cease using \ncollateral as a factor to determine whether a loan is non-performing or not. They must \nalso take into consideration forward-looking and qualitative factors, including \n“unlikely \npay” \nconditions \nwhile \ndetermining \nnon-performing \nstatus, \nthe \nreclassiﬁcation of loans from non-performing to performing, banks’ compliance to \nthe maximum-allowed loan iterations/restructuring as provided in the directive, the \nreporting of restructured loans, the reconciliation of diﬀerences between accounting \nand regulatory provisions, and the charging of provisions for oﬀ-balance sheet \nexposures.\nB. \nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk to the banking industry remained moderate and stable during the \nreview period, although exposure to sudden withdrawals by large depositors is \nhigh and has increased, based on a severe shock scenario assumption. The \n35\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n36\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nC. \nMarket and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nMarket risk is moderate but increasing. In a rising domestic interest rate \nenvironment, banks’ funding costs may increase since deposit liabilities are at variable \nrates, while a large amount of assets – corporate bonds held by CBE and DBE, and \ntreasury bonds held by private banks – are at ﬁxed rate. As a result, banks’ \nproﬁtability may deteriorate.\nThe banking system has well coped with the birr’s depreciation following the foreign \nexchange regime reform of July 2024. The results of the foreign exchange stress test \nfurthermore indicate that the banking industry CAR will remain above the minimum \nregulatory requirement of 8 percent under all scenarios, showing an overall high \ndegree of resilience, although the systemic bank has a relatively higher degree of \nexposure.\nliquidity risk is expected to increase in the short and medium terms.  The banking \nindustry is expected to maintain a robust liquidity position and resilience to short-term \nliquidity shocks. However, downside risks persist, including a failure to meet weekly \nliquidity requirements, real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) payment \nrequirements, asset and liability mismatches and funding gaps at the short-term \nmaturity buckets, and high deposit concentrations. Although the latter are lower when \nconsidering deposits by the private sector only, they may suggest the need for tighter \nregulatory standards on deposit concentration risks.\nAs banks mobilize short-term deposits and invest same in long-term assets, they \nnormally face an asset-liability time mismatch on their books. To this end, it is critical \nfor banks to manage their liquidity risk and maintain adequate liquidity that will enable \nthem to proactively and eﬀectively meet their obligations at all times. Most banks in \nEthiopia comply with NBE’s 15 percent minimum liquidity ratio requirement and have \na proven track record of meeting payment obligations in the RTGS. NBE is closely \nmonitoring banks with liquidity challenges and weaker liquidity risk management \npractices. It also engages with such banks to ensure that corrective and remedial \nactions for addressing the observed liquidity issues are implemented to prevent any \nnegative spillovers to the overall ﬁnancial system. \nGoing forward, NBE will take the necessary measures to ensure that banks implement \nsound and comprehensive liquidity management supported by adequate liquidity risk \nmanagement tools. These include actively engaging in the interbank money market, \nutilizing the NBE short-term liquidity facilities, and improving their internal liquidity \nmanagement governance, stress tests, contingency planning, and cash ﬂow \nprojections.\n\n37\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nThis section focuses on the stability and vulnerability to risks of the MFI and the \ncapital goods ﬁnance business sectors. Given their share of its monetary value, these \nsectors are not expected to pose a signiﬁcant risk to Ethiopia’s overall ﬁnancial \nsystem, but institutions have a big social impact for a number of beneﬁciaries. They \ntotaled 829,078 loan clients and 5,586,302 savers at end of the review period.\nAt the end of June 2024, all MFIs together accounted for 1.8 percent of the ﬁnancial \nsector’s total assets, and all capital goods ﬁnance companies for 0.2 percent (see \nTable 3 in section 3.1 above). Therefore, the analysis in this section is limited, as it is \nfocused on ﬁnancial stability when compared to that of the banking sector. More \ndetails are provided in this report’s annexes.\nAt the end of June 2024, 56 microﬁnance institutions 15 (with a total of 1,138 \nbranches) and six capital goods ﬁnance companies 16 (with a total of 56 branches) \nwere operating in Ethiopia.\n3.3 MICROFINANCE AND CAPITAL GOODS \n \nFINANCE BUSINESS SECTORS\nD. \nOperational Risk\nThere is signiﬁcant operational risk in the Ethiopian commercial banking \nindustry, and it is expected to rise further in the short to medium term. Incidents \nof social engineering, insider threats and third-party risks are on the rise. The gross \ncost of bank fraud and forgeries increased to 1.3 billion birr from 1.0 billion birr a year \nago. These cases occurred at 28 banks (almost every bank), mainly through the use \nof fake cash notes and cheques, embezzlement, the issuance of unauthorized bank \nguarantees, withdrawals using stolen ATM cards, and false calls or texts. \nCommercial banks are introducing new technology-based products and services that \nenhance eﬃciency and ﬁnancial inclusion but entail signiﬁcant operational risks. \nMoreover, an increasing number of banks are applying to introduce digital micro \ncredit and savings services that are provided through partnerships with third parties. \nAs a consequence, incidences of fraud and embezzlement could increase. In that \nregard, policies for banks and eﬀective strategies for measuring and mitigating \noperational risks need to put in place. In addition, this would pose an elevated cyber \nrisk to the banking system more than ever before.\n15  The analysis for the microﬁnance sector excludes data for the microﬁnance institutions that have been  \ntransformed into banks from the end of June 2019 to the end of June 2023 (Amhara Credit and Saving Institution, \nOromia Credit and Saving Institution, Omo MFI, Somali MFI, Addis Credit and Saving Institution, and Sidama MFI).\n16   Waliya Capital Goods Finance Business S.C, Oromia Capital Goods Finance Business S.C, Addis Capital Goods \nFinance Business S.C, Debub Capital Goods Finance S.C, Kaza Capital Goods Finance Business S.C, and Ethio \nLease Ethiopia Goods Finance Business S.C.\n\nTable 9: Major Balance Sheet Items of the Ethiopian Microﬁnance Institution Sector, \n \n \n  2020-2024 (billion birr)\nSource: NBE Database\nSource: NBE Database\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy and Debt Equity Ratios in the Microﬁnance Sector, \n \n    \n   2020-2024 (percent)\nCAR (%)\nDER (%)\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n27.0\n26.0\n25.0\n24.0\n23.0\n22.0\n21.0\n20,0\n500.0\n400.0\n300.0\n200.0\n100.0\n0.0\nCAR\nDebt to Equity (DER)\n22.6\n23.5\n24.5\n26.3\n22.9\n444.2\n467.0\n414.7\n354.0\n427.2\n38\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n17 This applies to MFIs established in 2023 and later; already existing MFIs must reach the 75 million birr by the end \nof January 2028; see NBE Directive No. MFI/36/2023.\n3.3.1   Microﬁnance Sector \nThe microﬁnance sector’s balance sheet grew strongly and remained sound and \nstable in the year to the end of June 2024. Total assets increased by 21.6 percent \n(from 49.4 billion birr to 60.1 billion birr) and total deposits by 29.2 percent (from 24.3 \nbillion birr to 31.4 billion birr), respectively. Liquid assets and net loans also increased \nby 28.4 percent and 26.9 percent, respectively, while NPLs increased much more \nmoderately, at 6.3 percent (Table 9). Capital increased by 4.7 percent, and a further \nincrease is anticipated because each microﬁnance institution is required to reach a \nminimum of 75 million birr within seven years.17  Also, 54 microﬁnance institutions with \nnew injections of capital were under formation at the end of June 2024.\n \nMajor items \nJune \n2020 \nJune \n2021 \nJune \n2022 \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nChange \n2024 vs. \n2023 (%) \nA \nAssets \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \nTotal liquid assets \n5.5 \n6.7 \n7.8 \n9.5 \n12.1 \n28.4 \n \nGross loans \n17.4 \n20.2 \n25.3 \n31.5 \n39.7 \n26.0 \n \nProvisions \n1.0 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n \nNet loans \n16.4 \n18.9 \n23.9 \n30.4 \n38.6 \n26.9 \n \nGross NPLs (PAR>90 days) \n1.1 \n2.0 \n2.2 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n6.3 \n \nTotal assets \n24.4 \n28.7 \n36.9 \n49.4 \n60.1 \n21.6 \nB \nLiability and Capital \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nTotal deposits \n14.4 \n16.9 \n18.9 \n24.3 \n31.4 \n29.2 \n \nBorrowings \n2.3 \n3.3 \n8.0 \n10.3 \n11.0 \n6.6 \n \nTotal capital \n4.5 \n5.1 \n7.2 \n10.9 \n11.4 \n4.7 \n \n\nSource: NBE Database\nLoans remain the biggest component of total assets, accounting for 66 percent of \nthem at the end of June 2024. Since the end of COVID-19, asset quality has \nsigniﬁcantly improved, indicating a recovery from the pandemic period. In the year \nto the end of June 2024, the NPL ratio decreased further to 3.6 percent from 4.2 \npercent a year earlier, meeting NBE’s requirement of less than 5 percent for the \nsecond time in ﬁve years (Figure 15).This again indicates a low risk level for the \nsector. The sector maintained strong bad debt coverage, as reﬂected by a \nprovisions-to-NPLs ratio of 76.7 percent at the end of June 2024, slightly lower than \nthe 80.6 percent recorded a year earlier.\nThe sectoral distribution of MFI loans shifed in the year to June 2024 (Figure 16): \nLoans to agriculture decreased from 21.6 percent of total microﬁnance loans in the \nyear to June 2023 to 18.0 percent in the year to June 2024, whereas loans to the \ntrade sector increased from 39.4 percent to 42.6 percent for the same period, \nindicating a strong shif away from rural area/agriculture loans. \nWith regards to NPLs, loans to agriculture accounted for the highest share, 38.2 \npercent, which may have contributed to MFIs’ decisions to shif away from \nagricultural loans (see Figure 28 in Annex B).\nFigure 15: Asset Quality Ratios of the Microﬁnance Sector, 2020-2024 (percent)\nNPLs Ratio\nProvision to NPLs\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n0\n12.0\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\n100.0\n80.0\n60.0\n40.0\n20.0\n0.0\nNPLs Ratio\nProvision to NPLs\n6.6\n9.9\n8.6\n4.2\n3.6\n87.6\n64.6\n64.1\n80.6\n76.7\n39\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\nFigure 17: Major Earning Ratios of the Microﬁnance Sector, 2020-2024 (percent)\nSource: NBE Database\nThe MFI sector’s proﬁtability continued in an overall positive trend in the year to the \nend of June 2024: total income increased by 39.4 percent to 8.9 billion birr while \ntotal expenses were only recorded at 13.4 percent to 5.9 billion birr. This resulted in a \nnet income of 3.0 billion birr, 148.5 percent higher than a year earlier (see Table 19 in \nAnnex B). Notably, the sector registered the highest proﬁtability ratio ever for the \nmeasures, return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE), recording 5.6 percent \nand 27.6 percent respectively at the end of June 2024 (Figure 17).\nConsidering individual MFIs, although some generated higher proﬁts than small \nbanks or insurance companies in Ethiopia, others are still loss makers/weak \ninstitutions even afer several years of operation. This situation is mainly attributable to \nthe absence of digitized services, which would increase eﬃciency and reduce costs, \nand a lack of strategic leadership and weak governance practices. This may require \npolicy measures aimed at consolidating the weak MFIs to create stronger institutions.\nRoE and RoA\nOSSR\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n30.0\n25.0\n20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\n20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\nReturn on equity (RoE)\nReturn on assets (RoA)\nOperational self suﬃciency (OSSR)\n18.8\n12.4\n18.3\n16.7\n13.9\n13.7\n14.3\n11.0\n13.4\n27.6\n2.5\n2.0\n2.7\n4.4\n5.6\n40\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nSource: NBE Database, see, Annex B\nFigure 16: Distribution of Microﬁnance Loans by Sector, June 2023 and June 2024 (percent)\na) June 2023\n \nb) June 2024\n \n \n \n21.6\n39.4\n7.0\n13.5\n13\n5.5\nAgriculture\nTrade\nManufacturing\nConstruction\nService\nOthers\n18.0\n42.6\n6.2\n11\n16.8\n5.3\n\nThe capital goods ﬁnance business sector’s loans grew by 35.3 percent to over 3.7 \nbillion 18 birr in the year to June 2024, from nearly 2.8 billion birr a year earlier (Table \n10). Total assets also increased by 18.4 percent to 6.4 billion birr, but total liquid \nassets declined by 45 percent to 416 million birr. NPLs more than doubled in the year \nto the end of June 2024, also implying an increase in the NPL ratio to 7.5 percent \nfor the same period, up from 5.1 percent a year earlier. This is 50 percent higher than \nthe regulatory maximum of 5 percent, reﬂecting a high credit risk.\nSource: NBE Database\nFinally, although the microﬁnance sector has met its liquidity requirements, it \nremains highly interconnected with and reliant on commercial banks: 87 percent of \nthe sector’s liquid assets are held at domestic banks. The liquidity ratio remained \nrelatively stable at 38.7 percent, well above NBE’s 20.0 percent minimum \nrequirement (Figure 18). However, the loan-to-deposit ratio of 126.4 percent \nindicates – despite reductions for two years in a row from 134.1 percent at the end \nof June 2022 – that the sector’s ﬁnancing in addition to deposits is still heavily \ndependent on borrowing from domestic banks and international organizations, such \nas the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Financial \nIntermediation Program.\nFigure 18: Microﬁnance Sector Liquidity Ratio Indicators, 2020-2024 (percent)\nLiquidity Ratio \nLoan to deposit ratio\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n41.5\n41.0\n40.5\n40.0\n39.5\n39.0\n38.5\n38.0\n37.5\n37.0\n36.5\n140.0\n135.5\n130.0\n125.0\n120.0\n115.0\n110.0\nLiquidity ratio\nLoan to deposit ratio\n38.3\n39.5\n41.3\n38.9\n44.2\n120.6\n119.5\n134.1\n129.6\n126.4\n3.3.2 \nCapital Goods Finance Business Sector\n41\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n18  This excludes lease ﬁnancing provided by DBE.\n\nSource: NBE Database\nTable 10: Major Balance Sheet Items of the Capital Goods Finance Sector, 2020-2024 (million birr)\nCapital goods ﬁnance companies do not accept deposits and rely on banks for a \nsigniﬁcant portion of their ﬁnancing.

At the end of June 2024, the capital-to-risk \nweighted asset ratio was 41.9 percent, the lowest since 2020, while the \ndebt-to-equity ratio reached 184.5 percent, the highest since 2020 – but still far \nbelow the threshold debt-to-equity ratio of 7:1, which signals that the sector is still \nsigniﬁcantly below its maximum borrowing capacity.\nIn terms of proﬁtability, the capital goods ﬁnance sector has incurred losses in three \nout of the last ﬁve years, with the highest loss experienced during the period under \nreview, mainly due to one private leasing company under liquidation proceedings. \nThe return on capital and return on assets measurement stood at near zero in \nprevious years, but they were clearly negative in the year to the end of June 2024, at \n-15.3 percent and -5.3 percent respectively (Figure 20). The number of leasing \ncompanies and their branches has remained the same over the last ﬁve years. This \nindicates there is a structural problem and a high risk for the sustainability of \noperations, which calls for corresponding policy measures to help the sector return \nto proﬁtability.\nFigure 21: Capital Goods Companies Soundness Indicators, 2020-2024 (percent)\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n5.0\n-\n(5.0)\n(10.0)\n(15.0)\n(20.0)\nReturn on Equity\nReturn on Asset\n0.6\n-0.02\n-0.6\n1.1\n-5.3\n0.3\n-0.04\n-0.3\n0.5\n-15.3\n68\n8.6\n93\n105\n52\n123\n185\nCAR\nDebt to equity ratio\nNPLs\n200\n150\n100\n50\n-\n73\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n5.3\n 2.9\n 2.8\n 5.1\n61\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\n-\nFigure 20: Major Proﬁtability Indicators of the Capital Goods Finance Sector, 2020-2024 \n \n \n    (percent)\nCAR and DER Ratio\nNPL Ratio\n43\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n55\n42\n\n3.3.3 Summary Assessment of Risks for Financial  \n \n \n  System Stability Emanating from the Microﬁnance  \n \n  and Capital Goods Finance Sectors\nNeither the microﬁnance sector nor the capital goods ﬁnance sector poses a risk to the \nEthiopian ﬁnancial system’s stability. This is not only a result of the relatively limited size of \nthese two sectors in the system, but also because they are assessed as sound overall.\nThe overall risk to the microﬁnance sector is considered low and stable: The capital \nadequacy, NPL, and liquidity ratios are all well within NBE’s parameters and have \nimproved over the review period. There is also remarkable growth in sector-wide \nproﬁtability, although with large variances across individual MFIs, which may call for policy \nmeasures aimed at consolidating the sector. Close links to banking also make the \nmicroﬁnance sector vulnerable to potential spillovers from the sector in terms of liquidity \nand borrowing. This risk may need to be addressed through appropriate policy \nmeasures.The capital goods ﬁnance business sector’s risk is rated as moderate but \nincreasing. This is because capital risk is assessed as low, and systemic risk is rated as \nmoderate. However, earnings, asset quality, and concentration risks are rated as high, \nand may require regulatory measures to reduce the risk levels.\n3.4 INSURANCE SECTOR\nAs of June 30th, 2024, the number of insurance companies operating in the Ethiopian \nmarket stood at 18, of which one is state owned.  The sector consists of 14 composite \ninsurance companies transacting both long-term and general insurance businesses, and \nfour general insurance companies trading only non-life/short-term insurances. The \ncompanies carry diﬀerent licenses based on the main lines of insurance business they \nconduct. So far, no company has exclusively conducted a long-term business. Moreover, \none locally incorporated reinsurance company (Ethio-Re) is operating as a local reinsurer. \nBesides, 2,894 insurance agents, 62 insurance brokers, 117 loss assessors and three \nsurveyors operate in the sector. Africa-Re and PTA-Re (ZEP-RE), two overseas \nreinsurance companies with considerable presence in the sector, have local contact \noﬃces in Ethiopia. The companies accept Ethiopian birr as their trading currency. In \naddition, ﬁve insurance companies are authorized to provide non-conventional, \nSharia-compliant insurance (takaful) as “window operators19”; while one full-ﬂedged \ntakaful operator (Amana Takaful) is under formation.\nNBE issued a directive on motor insurance’s minimum premium rate to try and bring the \nlingering practice of premium undercutting in the industry to an end. It also has drafed \namendments on the Requirements for Persons with Signiﬁcant Inﬂuence in an Insurer, \nFinancial Reporting, and Licensing of Insurance Broker Directive. In addition, NBE carries out \non-site inspections and oﬀ-site surveillance of insurance companies and monitors the \nimplementation of supervisory concerns to strengthen the resilience of insurance companies\n44\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n19 Window operators are conventional insurance service providers that also provide sharia compliant services \nthrough a dedicated window operation.\n\nStronger underwriting resulted in improved sector proﬁtability, which is considered \nsound. Insurers generated a net income before tax of 6.5 billion birr and 0.4 billion \nbirr from the general and long-term insurance businesses, respectively. This \ncorresponds to a return on equity of 31.5 percent for general and 21.9 percent for \nlong-term classes of business. However, inﬂation led to losses on insurers’ ﬁxed \nincome holdings of bank deposits. The ﬁve-year average return on investment in the \ngeneral insurance class of business was 9.6 percent. \nThe insurance sector registered a record gross premium of 28.7 billion birr at the end \nof June 2024, 23.7 percent higher than a year earlier and above the inﬂation rate of \n19.9 percent. The general class of business accounted for 92.0 percent (26.4 billion \nbirr) of the sector’s gross written premium, while the long-term business and takaful \nSource: NBE Database\n3.4.1  Performace of the Sector\nThe total assets of the sector stood at 65.6 billion birr at end of June 2024, up 32.0 \npercent from the previous year (Table 12). The general insurance business accounted for \n93.2 percent of the sector’s total assets during the period under review. Sector assets \nwere oﬀset by liabilities of 43.2 billion birr, up 29.3 percent from the previous year (33.4 \nbillion birr). This resulted in net assets of 22.4 billion birr, up 37.4 percent from the \nprevious year (16.3 billion birr).\nThe 32 percent growth of total assets was ﬁnanced by an increase in liabilities (by 9.8 \nbillion birr, or 61.6 percent of the total asset increase) and equity (by 6.1 billion birr, or 38.4 \npercent of the total asset increase). The increase in capital is mainly attributable to \noperational results, which are partly due to an increase in paid-up capital. This is \nattributable to NBE’s directive that requires insurers to increase their paid-up capital to \n0.4 billion birr by the end of June 2027. \nTable 11 : Financial Performance of the Insurance Sector (billion birr)\n45\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nItem \nJune \n2020 \nJune \n2021 \nJune \n2022 \nJune \n2023 \nJune \n2024 \nChange \n2023-2024 (%) \nAssets \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \nTotal Assets \n29 \n39.1 \n40.8 \n49.7 \n65.6 \n32.0% \nTotal Investment \n15 \n19 \n22 \n28.9 \n36.4 \n26.0% \n  Equity Investment \n2.8 \n3.6 \n4.9 \n5.9 \n7.3 \n23.7% \n  Bank Deposits \n10.3 \n13.3 \n14.4 \n19.4 \n24.5 \n26.3% \nCurrent Assets \n20.3 \n29.1 \n28.3 \n35.1 \n46.4 \n32.2% \nLiability and Capital \n \n \nTotal Liability \n19.4 \n28 \n27.4 \n33.4 \n43.2 \n29.3% \nTotal Equity \n9.5 \n11.1 \n13.4 \n16.3 \n22.4 \n37.4% \nCurrent Liability \n18.9 \n27.3 \n26.7 \n32.5 \n42.1 \n29.4% \nPaid-up Capital \n5.0 \n5.9 \n7.1 \n9.0 \n11.7 \n30.0% \nNet proﬁt/loss Before tax \n2.3 \n2.7 \n3.3 \n4.1 \n6.9 \n68.3% \n \n\ninsurance accounted for the remaining 8.0 percent (Figure 29 in Annex D). In terms of \nproducts, 54.7 percent of the general insurance business is motor related, and 87.7 \npercent of the long-term business is term and permanent health insurance, which are \ntechnically short-term policies of one year. \nNet earned premium and net claims incurred for the general class of business was 16.9 \nbillion birr and 8.6 billion birr respectively at the end of June 2024. The respective \ngrowth of the net earned premium and net claims incurred was 44.5 percent and 26 \npercent. Underwriting expense for the general business was 5 billion birr, a 30.7 \npercent increase from the previous period of 3.7 billion birr. The resulting claims ratio \nand expense ratios were 50.9 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively (Figure 22). The \nperformance of the general insurance business, as measured by the combined ratio of \nthe loss and expense ratios, stood at 80.5 percent at the end of June 2024, better than \nthe 91 percent recorded in the previous year and the best in ﬁve years. The minimum \nmotor insurance premium rate that was issued by NBE in August 2023 might have \npartly contributed to the improved performance in this regard.\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n0%\n100%\n80%\n60%\n40%\n20%\nCombined Ratio\nClaims Ratio\nExpense Ratio\n31.2 %\n30 %\n33 %\n33 %\n61.8 %\n93.0 %\n57 %\n87.6 %\n56 %\n88.7 %\n58 %\n91.1 %\n29.6 %\n50.9 %\n80.5 %\nSource: NBE Database\nThe sector solvency, equity to liability, and liquidity positions have improved in 2024 \n(Figure 23). Equity as a percentage of liability stood at 63.2 percent, which is well \nabove the 20 percent minimum prudential requirement. The industry maintained a \nsolvency ratio (statutory capital compared to required capital) of 316 percent, showing \na 73 percentage-point increment from the last reporting period. In addition, the sector \nis liquid with a liquidity ratio – this measures the percentage of an insurers’ liability \nagainst the available liquid assets – that stood at 92.6 percent in June 2024. This was \na marginal improvement over last year’s result of 94.6 percent. 20 There were no \nsigniﬁcant changes in the investment portfolio composition. Even though general \ninsurers are required to invest a minimum of 60 percent of their total assets in liquid \nassets, mainly in bank deposits and government securities, the actual result in this \nregard is 48 percent, which signiﬁes a material shortfall. \nFigure 22: General Insurance Business Operational Performance\n46\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n20 Liquidity is measured as current liability divided by current assets. The maximum standard is 105 percent. The \nlower the ratio, the lower the liquidity risk. A decreasing ratio is therefore an indication of a decreasing liquidity risk.\n\nOperational Risk: A lack of technical expertise in insurance is a real constraint. Most \ninsurance companies’ operations remain underdeveloped and unautomated. There \nare hurdles to overcome to implement IFRS 1721  due to the unavailability of data and \na lower level of automation for the industry’s core business. The implications of this \nwill be seen in the ﬁnancial reporting period for the year to the end of June 2024.\nInsurance Risk: This refers to the risk that inadequate or inappropriate underwriting, \nproduct design, pricing and claims settlement expose an insurer to ﬁnancial losses \nand a consequent inability to meet its liabilities. Ethiopia’s insurance sector is known \nfor its stiﬀ price competition in all classes of business. Insuﬃcient premiums could \nleave industry players unable to meet their obligations from claims.\nConcentration Risk: The government-owned insurance corporation accounts for 32 \npercent of the market share. In addition, Ethiopian Reinsurance Company receives 25 \npercent of treaty cession and 5 percent of each policy insurers underwrite. Moreover, \n55 percent of the general class of business is motor insurance, which needs to be \ndiversiﬁed going forward.\nFigure 23: Key Soundness Indicators in the General Business, 2020–2024\nSource: NBE Database\nJUN-20\nJUN-21\nJUN-22\nJUN-23\nJUN-24\n0%\n400%\n350%\n300%\n250%\n200%\n150%\n100%\n50%\nLiquidity\nSolvency\nEquity-to-liability\n38.9%\n54.3 %\n53.8%\n48.3%\n95.8 %\n203 %\n95.8 %\n328 %\n96.8%\n334 %\n94.6%\n243%\n316.0\n92.4\n63.2\n47\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nThe main risks faced by the insurance sector are due to changes in macroeconomic \npolicies and risks related to insurance, operations, markets, and the sector’s \nconcentration of players. Pressing concerns are market penetration, speciﬁcally in \nthe life class of the business; a shortage of insurance professionals, such as \nactuaries; and inadequate IT infrastructure in the industry and regulatory body.\n3.4.2   Summary Assessment of Risks for Financial \n \n    System Stability Emanating from the \n \n    Insurance Sector \n21 IFRS 17 is the newest IFRS standard for insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4 on January 1st, 2022. It states \nwhich insurance contracts items should by on the balance and the proﬁt and loss account of an insurance \ncompany, how to measure these items, and how to present and disclose this information.\n\n 22 Cooperative societies in Ethiopia are established and administered in accordance with Proclamation No. 985/2016.\n48\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nMarket Risk: The investment portfolio of insurers is restricted to bank deposits by \nlaw. Such provisions could inhibit insurers from earning higher returns that could \nenable the further development of the sector. \nDespite the potential ﬁnancial stability headwinds, the sector outlook remains \npositive in terms of growth, stability and resilience. Technology development and \nautomation are necessary to tackle operational risks. The sector also needs to build \nits capacity to expand the pool of insurance professionals. Furthermore, focus \nshould also be given to the implementation of risk-based capital and IFRS 17.\n3.5 HIGHLIGHTS ON SAVINGS AND CREDIT  \n \n       COOPERATIVES AND PENSION FUNDS\nSavings and Credit Cooperatives\nEthiopia has a large network of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs)22  – over \n21,000 in total – which play an important role in ﬁnancial inclusion, especially in the \nunderserved rural areas. Nevertheless, SACCOs have limited capacity to increase \ntheir market share and become truly competitive ﬁnancial institutions due to \nlimitations in size, skills, products, use of technology, and operational models. From \nthe point of view of the ﬁnancial system’s stability, SACCOs pose no systemic risk due \nto the limited size of the sector.\nPension Funds\nPension funds in Ethiopia are administered by two agencies, the Public Employees \nSocial Security Administration Agency as per provisions of Proclamation \nNo.1267/2022, and the Private Organization Employees Social Security Fund \nAdministration Agency as per provisions of Proclamation No. 1268/2022. \n\n4. \nFINANCIAL SYSTEM \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nDEVELOPMENT \nAND RISKS\n\n4.1 NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT\n4.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM \n    INFRASTRUCTURE         \n \n \n \n \nDEVELOPMENT AND RISKS\nPayment systems in Ethiopia were radically modernized in 2011 afer NBE launched \nthe Ethiopian Automated Transfer System (EATS), an interbank payment system \ncomprising both the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system 23 and the automated \nclearing house (ACH). 24  NBE owns and manages the EATS, which provides facilities \nfor the ﬁnal settlement of payments between ﬁnancial institutions and clearing and \nnetting services for bulk payments. Before 2011, all payments in the country, including \nbank-to-bank transfers, were made through the exchange of letters; as a result, a \nsingle interbank transfer took days to settle.\nThe ﬁnancial sector’s dependency on the RTGS infrastructure has increased over \ntime, and the EATS is the only ﬁnancial market infrastructure designated as a \nsystematically important payment system in Ethiopia. To ensure its safety, eﬃciency, \nand reliability, NBE has established a robust regulatory framework. (Box 5) Due to \neﬀective oversight and administration, the EATS operated at 99.9 percent reliability \nduring the year to June 2024.\nThis chapter discusses developments and risks for the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial \nsystem related to its infrastructure. The infrastructure comprises currency \nmanagement, the payment and settlement system, credit market infrastructure, and \nﬁnancial inclusion and consumer protection.\nBox 5: \nPayment System Regulatory Framework and Developments\nThe digital payments ecosystem has seen signiﬁcant growth over the last few years. \nAs of June 2024, there are over 198 million digital accounts, including more than 110 \nmillion mobile money accounts and 47 million mobile banking accounts. Additionally, \nmore than 35 million debit cards are in circulation. These advancements are \npromoting ﬁnancial inclusion for many Ethiopians. On average, the digital payments \necosystem processes over 7.5 million transactions daily, with a total transaction value \nexceeding 26.5 billion birr. These ﬁgures highlight the country’s increasing reliance on \ndigital platforms and the impact of technology on its ﬁnancial landscape.\n23  The RTGS is an electronic form of funds transfer for high value or sensitive payments, where money transfer takes \nplaces from one participant to another in real-time and on an individual basis. All participants maintain a payment and \nsettlement account in RTGS for ﬁnal settlement of the transactions between them.\n24  ACH is a system where low value large volume transactions (bulk transactions) are cleared and a net settlement \ninstruction is produced. It is an electronic clearing house for cheque, Credit Transfer (CT) and Direct Debit (DD) \ninstruments. In ACH, settlement does not happen; rather, it produces net settlement instructions and sends them to \nRTGS for ﬁnal settlement. Each instrument, which is cleared in the ACH, requires a separate rule and arrangement.\n50\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n4.1.1  Payment Systems Performance\n4.1.1.1. Ethiopian Automated Transfer System\nAt the end of June 2024, 35 ﬁnancial institutions participated in EATS, of which three \nwere MFIs. No major EATS interruption was reported in the year under review. The \nsystem processed more than 3.5 million transactions (down by 8.5 percent from the \nprevious year) with a value of more than 4 trillion birr (an annual decrease of 17 \npercent). The decline in both volume and value of RTGS transactions is mainly due to \nthe rise of other interoperable digital payment channels, such as mobile banking.\n51\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nIn the coming years, the country's digital payments landscape is expected to undergo \na signiﬁcant transformation, and further enhancing the growth and accessibility of this \ntype of technology. The shif will position the payments infrastructure as a key enabler \nof ﬁnancial inclusion and economic growth. Several strategic initiatives are driving this \nprogress. They include:\n• Building secure and eﬃcient digital public infrastructure. By integrating the \ninstant payments infrastructure that is currently implemented by the national \nswitch, with the national ID system (Fayda), NBE aims to create a more secure, \neﬃcient, inclusive, and interoperable digital payments landscape that promotes \nﬁnancial inclusion and economic development.\n• Expanding the instant payments system’s services. These services will allow con-\nsumers to conduct transactions in real-time, which is essential for fostering a \ndynamic economy.\n• Creating a more enabling regulatory framework. This framework will ensure the \ndigital payments industry operates smoothly, securely, and in compliance with \nregulations. Learning from the implementation of the National Digital Payment \nStrategy (NDPS) 1.0, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) is set to launch NDPS \n2.0 in early 2025. This new strategy aims to establish a robust digital payments \necosystem that provides a strong foundation for the country’s ﬁnancial system \nand economic growth.\nThe newly introduced QR code standard for digital payments in Ethiopia is also set to \nsimplify transaction processes for merchants across the country. This standard will \nenhance security and make payments more straightforward for customers and mer-\nchants, thereby expanding access to digital payments platforms for both retail and \nwholesale merchants. \nThe swif advance of digital payments systems in Ethiopia, complemented by strategic \ninitiatives proposed by NBE, will signiﬁcantly improve access to diverse ﬁnancial \nservices for the population. The expansion of a secure and interoperable digital \npayments ecosystem not only provides individuals and businesses with a greater \nrange of options for making payments, but it also fosters ﬁnancial inclusion, economic \ngrowth, and a growing conﬁdence among the public.\n\nSource: NBE Database \nImportant developments include the following: \nThe number of ATMs throughout the country grew by 34.2 percent to 10,551 at the \nend of June 2024 over the previous year. The number of PoS terminals deployed \nwithin ﬁnancial institutions and at merchant locations also increased by 16.7 percent \nto 14,030 at the end of June 2024 from a year earlier. This is due to the \ncommercialization of some non-bank PoS operators during the year.

This is \ndue to the services provided by many commercial banks, with 18 banks currently \noﬀering mobile banking at diﬀerent scales. Consequently, the number of registered \naccounts increased by 45 percent to 39.6 million by the end in June 2024 from a \nyear earlier. The number of mobile money/wallet users also increased by 56.6 \npercent from June 2023 to 107.5 million by the end of June 2024. The rapid growth \nwas largely attributed to the expansion of Telebirr mobile money services and the \noperationalization of M-Pesa by Safaricom Ethiopia PLC and Kacha Digital Financial \nServices S.C.\nInternet banking in Ethiopia is still in its infancy relatively speaking, with 12.2 million \nusers by the end of June 2024, but it is growing rapidly. The number of mobile \nmoney agents increased by 78.1 percent at the end of June 2024 compared to the \nprevious year, reaching 415,084 agents. The increase is mainly attributed to the \nexpansion of Telebirr in the market.\nDigital payments are growing at an exponential rate (Table 14). In the year to June \n30th, 2024, payments worth more than 9.6 trillion birr were processed digitally, an \nincrease of more than 50 percent compared to the previous year. This growth is the \nresult of the successful implementation of the National Digital Payment Strategy and \nNBE’s reform activities.\nTable 14: Transactions Processed Through Digital Financial Services, 2020-2024 \n \n \n  (number of transactions in million and value in billion birr)\n53\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nYear \nending \nATM\n \nPoS\n \nMobile Banking\n \nInternet \nBanking \nAgent Banking\n \nMobile Money \n \nAggregate DFS\n \nVolume \nValue  Volume Value Volume \nValue Volume \nValue Volume \nValue Volume \nValue Volume \nValue \nJune 2020 \n153.19 142.07 \n1.36 \n4.85 \n11.62 \n68.38 \n0.53 \n22.55 \n4.24 \n1.40 \n4.24 \n2.96 \n175 \n242.20 \nJune 2021 \n225.60 236.09 \n2.95 \n7.44 \n39.56 \n326.18 \n2.41 \n26.59 \n23.00 \n8.94 \n7.25 \n5.94 \n301 \n611.18 \nJune 2022 \n171.07 \n197.54 \n2.34 \n62.18 \n88.01 \n163.57 \n1.09 \n129.57 \n34.39 \n23.01 \n48.50 \n24.36 \n345 1,600.24 \nJune 2023 \n356.38 478.32 \n6.60 40.84 \n474.92 3,442.58 \n5.80 358.14 \n101.95 \n76.54 298.83 \n380.30 \n1,244 4,776.72 \nJune 2024 \n437.98 \n728.51 \n10.15 24.24 \n1,114.81 \n6,717.58 \n15.12 749.05 \n130.35 446.00 764.88 1,028.59 \n2,473 9,693.97 \n\n4.1.2  Interoperability\nInteroperability is key to a stable, successful, and inclusive digital payments \necosystem. The vast majority of countries worldwide have recognized the importance \nof a local switch that enables interoperability and has optimal infrastructure for banks \nto connect to and allows real-time payments 24/7.\nThrough its national switch, Ethswitch, Ethiopia has successfully implemented a \ncomprehensive digital payments framework, achieving full-scale interoperability for \nvarious payment methods, including person-to-person (P2P) payments, ATM cash \nwithdrawals, PoS transactions, and the use of quick response (QR) codes for seamless \nﬁnancial exchanges. As a result, the number and value of transactions have grown \nexponentially (Table 15).\nTable 15: Interoperability Performance Through ATM, Point of Sale and Person-to-Person Transactions,\n \n \n 2020-2024\nThe smooth and eﬃcient functioning of the national switch is vital for the growth of \nthe digital payment landscape in the country. Recognizing this importance, NBE has \nprovided extensive support to enhance the capabilities of the national switch. This \nsupport is not only aimed at ensuring that the system operates at its maximum \ncapacity, it also focuses on developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the \nwidespread adoption and integration of digital payments solutions throughout \nEthiopia.\n54\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nPayment systems risk includes potential losses to entities or individuals, such as a \nbank’s customers or third parties, that send or receive payments. Accordingly, it is \nimportant for a bank’s risk management practices and internal controls to evolve and \nkeep up with changes in the bank’s payment systems, products, and services. Like \nany other system globally, developments in the country’s payment system are \nexposed to several risks, including operational, liquidity, compliance, reputation, \nsystemic, fraud, and settlement.\nSource: NBE Database\n4.1.3  Summary Assessment of Payment System \n \n  Risks and Outlook \n  \nJune 2020 \nJune 2021 \nJune 2022 \nJune 2024 \nJune 2024 \nATM transactions \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber \n15,044,699 \n24,166,034 \n39,894,113 \n71,433,041 \n94,030,684 \nValue (billion birr)  \n12.78 \n26.56 \n44.9 \n89.7 \n119.24 \nPOS transactions \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber \n1,107 \n109,506 \n361,317 \n970,434 \n2,345,444 \nValue (billion birr)  \n1.02 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n2.6 \n5.51 \nP2P transactions \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber \n0 \n29,881 \n2,067,710 \n14,140,881 \n55,204,745 \nValue (billion birr)  \n0 \n0.2 \n19.9 \n113.3 \n283.01 \n\n55\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\nLiquidity risk refers to the potential for participants to lack suﬃcient funds to meet \ntheir settlement obligations. This leads to disruptions in the smooth functioning of the \nsystem and settlement failure, which reduces the eﬃciency and reliability of the \npayment system, aﬀecting peer participants and their clients. Short-term liquidity \nproblems were seen on the system by a few participants during the period. The \nrecently established Standing Lending Facility should serve as a safety net for \nparticipants during times of unexpected liquidity shortages in the period ahead.\nCompliance risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from a \nfailure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, leading to \nincreased exposure to other risks such as operational, credit, and liquidity risks. No \nmajor failures to comply with NBE regulatory requirements were seen from the \npayment service providers during the period, as NBE has established robust \nregulatory frameworks to reduce the likelihood of non-compliance, and it maintains a \nstrong reputation for adherence to legal and regulatory standards.\nReputation Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from the \npublic’s negative perception of, or damage to, the payment system's reputation. This \ncan occur when a payment system fails to perform as expected, leading to loss of trust \namong participants, the public and customers. In the review period no issues were \nseen on the system that led to a loss of trust among its participants and customers. \nRegular monitoring and oversight of the payments system can mitigate the potential \nrisks.\nSettlement Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from the \nfailure of one party to fulﬁll its settlement obligations, leading to ﬁnancial losses or \ndisruptions in the settlement process. Continuous monitoring of the system, prudent \nliquidity management, establishing collateral requirements for participants with \nintraday credit exposure, and ensuring the ﬁnality and irrevocability of settlement can \nenhance the resilience of its processes, reduce the likelihood of settlement risk, and \ncontribute to the system’s overall stability and reliability. \nSystemic Risk refers to the potential for widespread disruptions across the ﬁnancial \nsystem that can occur due to the failure of a major payments system participant or a \nsystemic failure in the payments’ infrastructure. Such disruptions can have cascading \neﬀects, impact on multiple participants and undermine the system’s overall ﬁnancial \nstability. To mitigate systemic risks, it is crucial to implement a variety of measures. \nThese include enhanced monitoring and stress testing of the payments system, and \nthe establishment of strong contingency plans and robust coordination among \nregulatory authorities, ﬁnancial institutions, and payment system operators.\nFraud Risk involves the potential for fraudulent activities that can compromise the \nintegrity of payment systems and lead to ﬁnancial losses for participants. Fraudulent \nactivities can include unauthorized transactions, identity thef, and the manipulation of \n\n4.2 CREDIT MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE\npayment data. Eﬀective fraud risk management requires the implementation of \nadvanced fraud detection systems, regular monitoring for suspicious activities, and \nstrong authentication protocols. Additionally, educating users about security best \npractices and ensuring compliance with industry standards can further reduce the risk \nof fraud within the payments system.\nCyber Security Risk: Globally, attacks on information and communications \ntechnology systems (cyber-attacks) are increasing, targeting mostly the ﬁnancial \nsector. It poses signiﬁcant threats to the integrity, conﬁdentiality, and availability of \nﬁnancial transactions, leading to data breaches, the disruptions of services, fraudulent \ntransactions and reputational damage. No cyber security threats were reported to \nNBE from participants of EATS and DFS providers during the period. Strong security \ncontrols (like multifactor authentication), vendor security assessments, establishing \nredundant and backup systems to improve reliability, and collaboration with law \nenforcement bodies can enhance its cyber security posture and better protect against \npotential threats.\nOverall, the national payments system is expected to remain safe, eﬃcient, and \ntrusted among users in 2025. The performance of EATS and DFS products is \nexpected to show continuous growth both in value and volume terms, and they will \ncontinue to evolve and contribute to the country’s overall ﬁnancial stability. \nEthiopia’s Credit Reference Bureau (initially called the Credit Information Centre) was \nﬁrst established in 2004. Its main purpose was to lessen the diﬃculty of getting \nadequate and timely credit information that enables the satisfactory assessment of \nbanking sector borrowers’ credit worthiness. This will improve the loan portfolio and \nthe stability of the ﬁnancial system. \nInitially, credit information was manually made available to lending banks, which were \nmandated to grant loans and advances of 200,000 birr or more, only afer ﬁrst \nobtaining information from the Credit Information Centre. The system was upgraded \nand expanded in 2012 and again in 2019, incorporating MFIs and capital goods \nﬁnancing companies as subscribers, data providers, and users.\nIn summary, the expansion in the credit reporting system’s (CRS) coverage has \ncontributed substantially to ensuring an adequate loan portfolio in the banking and \nMFI industries. Going forward, the modernization of the CRS – including the upgrade \nof IT infrastructure, the modernization and streamlining of databases, and updating \nthe service-level agreements – will ensure that CRS’s operational risk remains stable.\n56\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n\n4.3 FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND CONSUMER \n \nPROTECTION\nTable 16: Credit Market Infrastructure Data\nSource: NBE Credit Reference Bureau\nFinancial inclusion is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development, and it \nplays a key role in stabilizing the country’s ﬁnancial system, job creation, digital \ntransformation, and Ethiopia’s continued economic growth. It allows ﬁnancial \ninstitutions to access diversiﬁed funding sources and improve their ability to manage \ntheir liquidity risks. Expanding ﬁnancial access and use in severely underserved areas \nis a national priority and NBE’s long-standing target. In response to these policy \nobjectives, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy II was developed and is now in \nthe process of being implemented. In support of this, a comprehensive regional \nﬁnancial inclusion framework has been developed and launched during the year for \nnine regional states. The framework is mainly prepared to aggressively expand \nﬁnancial access to underserved areas, narrow the regional ﬁnancial inclusion disparity \nand accommodate the regional context. \nOver the past ﬁve years, the number of transaction accounts 25 has increased at an \naverage annual rate of 31 percent, reaching 272 million at the end of June 2024. Of \nthese, the total number of interest-free deposit accounts accounted for 23.7 million. \nAccordingly, the number of transaction accounts per 100 adults reached 477 at the \nend of June 2024, compared to 365 a year before and the National Finance Inclusion \nStrategy II’s (NFIS-II) headline target of 286 (Figure 24). The number of traditional and \ndigital ﬁnancial access points has expanded signiﬁcantly. Their combined number \nincreased by 64.4 percent from 271,203 at the end of June 2023 to 445,856 a year \nlater. In terms of access points per capita, 782 ﬁnancial access points served \n100,000 adults during 2024, compared with 493 access points per 100,000 adults \nin 2023.\n57\nFINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\nNATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA\n \nJune \n2020\nJune  \n2021  \nJune  \n2022  \nJune\n2023\nJune  \n2024  \nNumber of subscribers to the CRS \n19\n19 \n23 \n  28\n  30 \nTotal number of borrowers listed in the CRS \n131,167\n170,456 \n208,090 \n263,790\n 336,549 \n   Individual borrowers \n120,728\n157,541 \n193,542 \n247,317\n316,928 \n   Non-Individual borrowers \n10,439\n12,915 \n14548 \n16,473\n19,621 \nTotal number of credit accounts in the CRS \n312,037\n388,329 \n456,439 \n553,445\n 669,711 \n \n25   This includes regular deposit accounts and mobile money wallets of commercial banks and other payment \ninstrument issuers.\n\nFurthermore, the total number of credit accounts in the ﬁnancial sector increased \nfrom 6.4 million at the end of June 2023 to 10.5 million at the end of June 2024 – \na growth rate of 64.3 percent (Figure 25). During the year, there were a total of 4.1 \nmillion new digital credit users. As a result, the total number of credit accounts per \n100 adults increased to over 18 at the end of June 2024 against 11.6 at the end of \nJune 2023 and far above the NFIS-II’s headline target of 12.8.\nFinancial consumer protection is another important intervention area for NBE, which \naims to enhance the trust and conﬁdence of the general public by ensuring \ntransparency, fairness, and consumer rights. Accordingly, NBE issued the relevant \nFinancial Consumer Protection Directive and established a directorate dedicated to \nthe supervision of the market, dispute resolution, and ensuring ﬁnancial consumer \nrights are fully protected, and market conﬁdence is maintained. During the year, a \ntotal of 3,345 ﬁnancial consumer complaints related to transaction failure, \nunauthorized transactions, data misuse, and fraud were received by ﬁnancial \ninstitutions. Of these, 48 percent are related to transaction failures.
